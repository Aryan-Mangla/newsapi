Edited by: Saikat Kumar Bose India News Jan 27, 2025 17:03 pm IST Published On Jan 27, 2025 17:00 pm IST Last Updated On Jan 27, 2025 17:03 pm IST Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email M Kharge made the remarks at 'Jai Bapu, Jai Bhim, Jai Samvidhan' rally in Mhow As BJP leaders race to take the holy dip during the Mahakumbh in Prayagraj, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has taken a swipe. At the 'Jai Bapu, Jai Bhim, Jai Samvidhan' rally in Madhya Pradesh's Mhow, Mr Kharge said BJP leaders kept taking dips for the camera. The Congress president questioned if taking dips into the Ganga would end poverty in the country or fill hungry stomachs. \"I don't want to question anyone's 'aastha (faith)'. If anyone feels bad, I apologise. But tell me, when a child is dying of hunger, is not going to school, labourers are not getting their dues, at such a time, these people are spending thousands of rupees and competing for taking dips (in the Ganga),\" he said, adding that the dips continue till it appears good in photographs. \"Such people cannot benefit the country. Our faith is in God -- people perform 'puja' at home every day, all women step out of their homes after performing 'puja', there is no issue. But we have an issue with the poor being exploited in the name of religion,\" Mr Kharge said. Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, was also present at the event. His remarks came on a day Union Home Minister Amit Shah took a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj. The Congress president's remarks have drawn a sharp response from the BJP. Party MP and spokesperson Sambit Patra said the Congress's hatred was an attack on the faith of crores of Hindus. \"Mahakumbh has been the symbol of the Sanatana faith for ages. I am pained to say that while the entire world reveres this faith, the biggest opposition party in India is ridiculing the Mahakumbh and this faith. They are making a mockery of it,\" he told the media. Mr Patra said the Congress president's remarks on the Mahakumbh and Ganga have hurt crores. \"He questioned if taking a dip in the Ganga would remove poverty, provide jobs, or bring happiness to the people. I challenge Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to make such remarks about any other religion's faith. Can they question if people get jobs or if poverty is alleviated by going to an Iftaar party? They cannot even imagine toying with the faith of any other religion. Such remarks are shameful. How can the Congress have such anti-Sanatan mindset?\" he asked.

NDTV News Desk India News Jan 27, 2025 15:26 pm IST Published On Jan 27, 2025 15:12 pm IST Last Updated On Jan 27, 2025 15:26 pm IST Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email New Delhi: A joint parliamentary committee has voted in favour of 14 alterations to the draft version of the Waqf Amendment Bill , which had been tabled in the Lok Sabha in August last year and seeks to make 44 contentious changes to the way Muslim charitable properties are managed in the country. The 14 alternations include distinguishing between the mandatory two non-Muslim members - as specified in the original draft of the bill - and nominated ex-officio members (Muslim or non-Muslim). This means waqf councils, whether at state or pan-India levels, will have at least two, and possibly more (if the nominated ex-officio members are also not Muslim) members not from the Islamic faith. Another key change is directing an officer nominated by the concerned state to determine if a property is 'waqf'. In the original draft this decision was left to the District Collector. A third change is establishing that the law will not apply retrospectively, so long as the property in question is already registered. To this point, Congress leader and JPC member Imran Masood raised a red flag, noting an estimated 90 per cent of waqf properties are not, in fact, registered. READ | Waqf Amendment Bill Cleared By JPC, 14 Amendments Approved These changes, and the 11 others, were proposed by members from the ruling BJP, including Lok Sabha MPs Nishikant Dubey, Tejasvi Surya and Aparajita Sarangi. Among the other 11 is a change - put forward by Mr Surya - specifying that anybody wishing to donate land must \"show or demonstrate that she/he is practicing Islam for at least five years\" and also acknowledge \"...there is no contrivance involved in the dedication of such property\". Overall, MPs from the ruling party and those allied to it made 23 proposals to alter the Waqf (Amendment) Bill. MPs from the opposition made 44 proposals, none of which were accepted. NDTV Explains | Women, Non-Muslims, Council Can't Claim Land: Waqf Changes But the opposition's proposals were rejected by a 10:16 vote after committee members voted on party lines; the JPC has 16 MPs from the BJP or allied parties and only 10 from the opposition. Voting to confirm acceptance of the 14 changes will take place January 29, and the final report will be submitted by January 31, sources told NDTV. The committee had originally been asked to file the report by November 29 but that deadline was extended to February 13, the final day of the Budget Session. Changes to the Waqf laws, sources told NDTV earlier, are meant to empower Muslim women who \"suffered\" under the old law. However, critics, including Trinamool leader Kalyan Banerjee, and AIMIM boss Asaduddin Owaisi (both JPC members), have called it a \"direct attack on freedom of religion\". READ | Opposition Targets Non-Muslims Provision In \"Draconian\" Waqf Bill Mr Owaisi and the DMK's Kanimozhi, meanwhile, also have argued it violates multiple sections of the Constitution, including Article 15 (the right to practice a religion of one's choice) and Article 30 (the right to minority communities to establish and administer their educational institutions). The 1995 Wakf Act was passed to regulate 'auqaf' (assets donated and notified as Waqf) by a 'wakif' (the person who dedicates the property). The legislation was last amended in 2013.

Kolkata: A probe into actor Saif Ali Khan's stabbing has led Mumbai Police to question a woman in West Bengal, for allegedly providing a mobile phone SIM card to the Bangladeshi national who had entered the country illegally, and has been arrested for the attack. Police sources said the woman, Khukumoni Sheikh, is from Chapra in Nadia district and was allegedly known to the accused Bangladeshi national, Shariful Islam. \"The SIM card the accused was using during his stay in India was traced to the woman. The woman is being questioned,\" a source said. Police had earlier said that Islam entered India through Meghalaya seven months ago and stayed in Bengal for a few weeks, before moving to Mumbai in search of a job. Cops involved in the interrogation of the accused said the 30-year-old crossed the Dawki river, along the India-Bangladesh border in Meghalaya, to illegally enter India. He then changed his name to Bijoy Das and began living in the country. Islam is a native of Jhalokathi district in Bangladesh, they said. Police said that during his stay in Bengal, Islam used a local resident's Aadhaar card to procure a mobile phone SIM card before moving to Mumbai. \"After reaching Mumbai, the accused chose to work in places where he was not required to furnish any documents. He studied till Class 12 in Bangladesh and had come to India in search of a job,\" an officer had said on condition of anonymity. On January 16, 54-year-old Khan suffered grievous injuries, after he was stabbed six times reportedly by Islam, during a failed burglary attempt at the actor's 12th floor residence in \"Satguru Sharan\" building in upscale Bandra. The doctors who performed an emergency surgery had removed a 2.5-inch piece of a broken knife from his spine afterwards. If the knife had pierced 2 mm deeper, it could have caused a severe injury, the doctors had noted. The actor was discharged from hospital and returned home on January 21.

New Delhi: The AAP and BJP continue to bicker as the clock ticks down to next week's Delhi Assembly election , with ex-Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal now accusing the latter of \"mixing poison\" in the city's water supply, in an attempt to \"create chaos... hoping the blame will fall\" on his party's administration. Speaking to reporters Monday, he said the BJP had done \"something that may never have been done in history\". He claimed the saffron party - in power in neighbouring Haryana - had added a poisonous substance to the Yamuna river that flows through that state and into the national capital. \"The people of Delhi get drinking water from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh... but the Haryana government has mixed poison in the water coming to Delhi from the Yamuna and sent it here... it is only due to the vigilance of our Delhi Jal Board engineers that this water was stopped.\" \"It (the allegedly poisoned water) was stopped at the Delhi border... we did not allow it to enter the city.

The Haryana government,… pic.twitter.com/vswQA87M7h — IANS (@ians_india) January 27, 2025 According to reports, the \"poison\" Mr Kejriwal was referring to is ammonia. High ammonia levels in the Yamuna has been a problem as the Delhi government scrambles to ensure round-the-clock, and clean, water supply for the city's residents; by some accounts the capital needs over 3,000 million litres of water per day, whereas the usual supply is only about 2,000 MLD.

The poll body sought a detailed report from the Haryana government by noon tomorrow, i.e., January 28. The debate around the cleanliness and potability of Yamuna water is of particular significance now, since these were assurances made by AAP boss Arvind Kejriwal before the 2020 Delhi election. Neither promise, though, has been fulfilled, and Mr Kejriwal is aware of this issue.

Either I fulfil them or I admit I promised but couldn't do it. I could not fulfill three promises - cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and making Delhi's roads of European standards,\" Mr Kejriwal said at a rally in Delhi's Laxmi Bai Nagar. He repeated that admission - a tactic seen as trying to take the sting out of attacks by the BJP on this topic - this morning as he released another section of his party's pre-poll manifesto.

A bench comprising Justice Bela M Trivedi and Justice Prasanna B Varale asked how the writ petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution could be maintained. The petitions were dismissed as withdrawn, granting petitioners liberty to seek alternative remedies under the law. Speaking at a conference in Chennai in September 2023, Junior Stalin had said 'Sanatana Dharma' was against social justice and equality and that it should be 'eradicated' like malaria and dengue.

Early yesterday, local police were informed about a suitcase dumped in a deserted area in east Delhi's Ghazipur. On reaching the spot, a police team found a body inside. The body was completely burnt. Police registered a case of murder and destruction of evidence and formed several teams to get to the bottom of this. Abhishek Dhania, Deputy Commissioner of Police for East Delhi, told the media, \"We didn't have any clue initially. Just a burnt suitcase and a burnt body. We started by scanning CCTV footage of the area where the suitcase was found.\" The officer said that the cops zeroed in on a Hyundai Verna that appeared suspicious and crossed the area hours before the body was found. Police tracked down the registration number to a Loni resident, but he told them he had sold the car to one Amit Tiwari. Police traced Amit Tiwari, 22, after tracking CCTV footage and took him into custody. Amit worked as a cab driver and was living in Ghaziabad. His friend Anuj Kumar, also seen in the CCTV footage, was also taken into custody. Anuj works as a welding mechanic and lives in Ghaziabad. On being questioned, Amit identified the body as that of his 22-year-old cousin Shilpa Pandey. Amit said he was in a relationship with Shilpa and they had been living together for a year. Shilpa wanted to marry him, but he had been trying to part ways with her. On Saturday night, Amit was drunk when he had an altercation with Shilpa. In a fit of rage, he choked her to death, police have said. He packed her body in a suitcase and called his friend Anuj to help him dump the body. \"The victim was a cousin in relation to the accused and pressured him to leave his family so as to permanently live together. Victim was also threatening to falsely implicate him and his family,\" a police statement said, adding that Anuj allegedly helped Amit destroy the body. According to police, Amit's original plan was to dump the body somewhere in western Uttar Pradesh. But soon after the duo set out, they crossed two checkpoints and Amit decided to dispose of the body somewhere closer. According to police, Amit has said they bought diesel worth Rs 160 from a petrol pump. They then reached a deserted area, dumped the suitcase with Shilpa's body in it and set it on fire. Police said they arrested Amit from Greater Noida. Shilpa's parents, the probe has found, work and live in Gujarat's Surat.

Indias fast-bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been named as the winner of the ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year award for 2024. Indo-Asian News Service Updated: January 27, 2025 04:05 pm IST Read Time: 2 min facebook twitter WhatsApp reddit E-mail India's fast-bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been named as the winner of the ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year award for 2024. Bumrah picked an astonishing 71 wickets while bowling 357 overs in 13 matches at an average of 14.92 in 2024. Bumrah's 71 scalps in 2024 made him just the fourth India bowler to take more than 70 Test wickets in a calendar year after Ravichandran Ashwin, Anil Kumble and Kapil Dev. Those numbers were enough for him to beat competition from Sri Lanka's Kamindu Mendis and England batting duo of Harry Brook, and Joe Root to win the prestigious award. It was a year where Bumrah excelled in both home and away conditions, proving to be a key contributor in keeping India in contention for a spot in the 2025 World Test Championship Final, though the side fell short of making it to the title clash. Bumrah's incredible 2024 began during India's memorable Test win against South Africa in Cape Town, where he picked eight wickets. He then went on to bag 19 wickets in India beating England 4-1 margin, with the highlight being a match haul of nine wickets and helping India to a series-levelling win in Visakhapatnam. Bumrah's most standout performance in Tests in 2024 came in the high-stakes Border-Gavaskar Trophy Series in Australia, where he picked 32 wickets in five matches at an average of 13.06 and a strike rate 28.37 to clinch the Player of the Series award. It was during the series in Australia that Bumrah crossed the 200 Test wickets milestone, becoming the 12th Indian bowler to do so, though it didn't help the visitors in avoiding a 3-1 series defeat. His best performance on tour of Australia came when he picked eight wickets in a stunning spell in Perth, including a five-wicket haul in the first innings, to lift India towards a 295-run win. Listen to the latest songs , only on JioSaavn.com Bumrah, 31, also set a unique record while achieving the feat, becoming the only bowler in Test history with a minimum of 200 dismissals to have an average less than 20 (19.4).

Edited by: NDTV News Desk World News Jan 27, 2025 18:32 pm IST Published On Jan 27, 2025 18:18 pm IST Last Updated On Jan 27, 2025 18:32 pm IST Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Artificial Intelligence (AI) is constantly evolving, and there's a new player in the market. DeepSeek, a new AI model from China, has captured the attention of the tech world, surpassing the likes of ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude AI in performance. What is DeepSeek? DeepSeek is an advanced AI model developed by a Hangzhou-based research lab of the same name. It was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, an engineer with a background in AI and quantitative finance. Based on the DeepSeek-V3 model, an advanced open-source AI system, it surpassed OpenAI's ChatGPT to become the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store in several countries, including the US, the UK, and China. DeepSeek's rise to prominence made a splash in Silicon Valley, challenging the belief that the US held a dominant position in this space. DeepSeek's latest release, R1, rivals industry leaders such as OpenAI and Anthropic but stands out for being cost-efficient, open source, and offering unlimited free usage. It enables high-performance AI access without the steep costs typically associated with such technologies. How is DeepSeek different from OpenAI and Meta? DeepSeek sets itself apart from competitors like OpenAI and Meta by focusing on affordability and efficiency. While companies like OpenAI and Meta develop highly advanced models that require significant resources and expensive AI chips (like Nvidia's H100 GPUs), DeepSeek has created models that perform similarly but at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's use of more affordable AI hardware and innovative approaches to model training enables it to compete with the big players while keeping costs low. Its chatbot app also offers unique features, such as articulating its reasoning before responding, distinguishing it from OpenAI's models like ChatGPT. This open-source approach allows developers to build on DeepSeek's technology, a key part of its appeal. Why is DeepSeek gaining attention? The key reason for the buzz around DeepSeek is that the Chinese AI assistant is free, unlimited, and open-source. It is celebrated for its transparency, efficiency, and ability to make AI accessible to everyone. DeepSeek's breakthrough comes at a time when the US has placed restrictions on advanced semiconductor exports to China, with the aim of limiting China's ability to advance in AI. DeepSeek has managed to work around these restrictions by developing models that require fewer resources. This has sparked concern in the US, where tech giants Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft have heavily invested in AI infrastructure that may soon face increased competition from low-cost alternatives like DeepSeek. Impact on US stocks The rise of DeepSeek has had an immediate effect on stock markets. Shares of major US AI-related companies, including Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft, dropped in response to DeepSeek's success. Analysts have warned that the rise of low-cost Chinese alternatives to established US AI models could disrupt the investment landscape, forcing companies to reconsider their AI strategies. As DeepSeek continues to gain traction, other companies in the AI supply chain, such as chipmakers and AI hardware manufacturers, may see their profits squeezed.

As a company, the Adani Group is still deeply engaged this year in the Mela, and, every single time I have a discussion on this subject, I am humbled by the vision our forefathers had. As someone who has built ports, airports and energy networks across India, I find myself astonished by this magnificent demonstration of what I call \"spiritual infrastructure\" – a force that has sustained our civilisation for millennia. Probably The World's Largest Management Case Study When Harvard Business School studied the Kumbh Mela's logistics, they marvelled at its scale. But, as an Indian, I see something deeper: the world's most successful pop-up megacity isn't just about numbers, it's about eternal principles that we at the Adani Group strive to embrace. Consider this: every 12 years, a temporary city larger than New York materialises on the banks of sacred rivers. No board meetings. No PowerPoint presentations. No venture capital. Just pure, time-tested Indian jugaad (innovation) backed by centuries of iterative learning. The Three Indestructible Pillars of Kumbh Leadership 1. Scale with Soul At the Kumbh, scale isn't just about size – it's about impact. When 200 million people gather with dedication and service, it is not just an event but a unique confluence of souls. This is what I call \"spiritual economies of scale\". The larger it grows, the more efficient it becomes, not just materially but in human and humanity terms. True scale is not measured in metrics but in the moments of unity it creates. 2. Sustainable Before Sustainability Was Cool Long before 'ESG' became a boardroom buzzword, the Kumbh Mela practised circular economy principles. A river is not just a source of water but the flow of life. Preserving it is a testament to our ancient wisdom. The same river that hosts millions returns to its natural state following the Kumbh, having cleansed hundreds of millions of devotees and confident that it can cleanse itself of all the \"impurities\" it washed away. Perhaps there's a lesson here for our modern development paradigms. Progress, after all, is not in what we take from the earth, but in how we give back to it. 3. Leadership Through Service The most powerful aspect? The absence of a single controlling authority. True leadership lies not in giving orders but in the ability to take everyone along. Various akharas (religious orders), local authorities and volunteers work in harmony. It is leadership through service, not dominance – a principle that modern corporations would do well to study. It teaches us that great leaders do not command or control – they create conditions for others to work together and collectively rise. Service is devotion, service is prayer and service itself is God. What The Kumbh Teaches Global Business As India aims for a $10 trillion economy, the Kumbh Mela offers unique insights: 1. Inclusive Growth The Mela welcomes everyone – from sadhus to CEOs, villagers to foreign tourists. It's the ultimate example of what we at Adani call \"Growth with Goodness\". 2. Spiritual Technology While we pride ourselves on digital innovation, the Kumbh showcases spiritual technology – time-tested systems for managing human consciousness at scale. This soft infrastructure is as crucial as physical infrastructure in an era where the biggest threat is mental illness. 3. Cultural Confidence In an era of global homogenisation, the Kumbh is a testament to cultural authenticity. It's not a museum piece – it's a living, breathing example of tradition adapting to modernity. Is the Future Ancient? As I walk through our ports or solar farms, I often reflect on the Kumbh's lessons. Our ancient civilisation didn't just build monuments – it created living systems that sustain millions. This is what we must aspire to in modern India – not just building infrastructure, but nurturing ecosystems. And, while nations compete with military might and economic muscle, the Kumbh represents India's unique soft power. Vasudeva Kutumbukam (the world is one family). It's not just about hosting the world's largest gathering, it's about showcasing a sustainable model of human organisation that has survived millennia. The Leadership Challenge Therefore, for modern leaders, the Kumbh poses a profound question: can we build organisations that last not just years, but centuries? Can our systems handle not just scale, but soul? In an age of AI, climate crisis and social fragmentation, the Kumbh's lessons are more relevant than ever an...",

New York, US: Amid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, law enforcement officials in the United States are reportedly doing recce of gurdwaras in New York and New Jersey to hunt for illegal immigrants. The action came as under the Trump administration, the US Department of Homeland Security revoked a Biden-era policy that prevented law enforcement in or near \"sensitive\" areas including places of worship. The officials from the Department of Homeland Security are targeting gurdwaras in New York and New Jersey as they are allegedly being used as a hub by Sikh separatists along with illegal and undocumented immigrants, according to a report by Press Trust Of India. Trump's Crackdown on Immigration Within hours of Donald Trump being sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman, in a directive, rescinded the Biden administration's guidelines for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforcement actions that thwart law enforcement in or near so-called \"sensitive\" areas. \"This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens-including murders and rapists-who have illegally come into our country,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,\" the spokesperson said. Action Draw Sikh Groups' Ire The move drew a sharp reaction from some Sikh organisations which see such actions as a threat to the sanctity of their faith. In a statement, the Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDF) expressed grave concern over the directive rescinding the guidelines that designated \"sensitive areas\", such as houses of worship, where immigration enforcement actions were previously restricted. \"This troubling shift in policy comes in tandem with community reports of DHS agents visiting gurdwaras in the New York and New Jersey areas just days after the directive was issued,\" SALDF said. \"We are deeply alarmed by the Department of Homeland Security's decision to eliminate protections for sensitive areas and then target places of worship like gurdwaras,\" said Kiran Kaur Gill, executive director of SALDEF. Gill said gurdwaras are not just places of worship; they are vital community centres that provide support, nourishment, and spiritual solace to Sikhs and the broader community. \"Targeting these spaces for enforcement actions threatens the sanctity of our faith and sends a chilling message to immigrant communities nationwide,\" he added. Sikh Coalition said the Trump administration's decision to rescind the DHS policy on \"protected areas\" (which also included hospitals, schools, social service providers, and more) opens the door to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducting surveillance, investigations, arrests, and raids at gurdwaras.\" \"The idea that our gurdwaras could be subject to government surveillance and raids by armed law enforcement with or without warrants is unacceptable to the Sikh faith tradition. It will burden religious exercise by limiting the ability of Sikhs to gather and associate with one another in accordance with our faith,\" Sikh Coalition said. \"It also harkens to dark periods in our collective memory when governments interfered in the ability of Sikhs to practice our faith freely-with deadly consequences,\" it said. \"If Sikhs-whether documented or undocumented-are concerned with gurdwara raids and surveillance, gurdwaras may well be impacted by decreased attendance, and thus an inability to carry out essential religious practices in a meaningful manner,\" said Sikh Coalition.

New Delhi: Uttarakhand will enforce a Uniform Civil Code today, laying a framework for uniform marriage, divorce, property, inheritance and adoption laws for all citizens. It will become the second state after Goa to have a uniform legal framework for citizens. The Code comes into effect almost a year after the Bill was passed in the Uttarakhand assembly, which was among the BJP's key election promises in the 2022 state polls. Among the clauses is the mandatory registration of live-in relationships and parental consent for live-in relationships involving individuals under the age of 21 years. The rule will apply to \"any resident of Uttarakhand... in a live-in relationship outside the state\". Failure to declare live-in relationships, or providing false information, could land a person in jail for three months or attract a fine of Rs 25,000, or both. Even a month's delay in registration could trigger a jail term of up to three months, a fine of Rs 10,000, or both. Marriages will need to be registered and the minimum age of marriage across religions will be 21 years for men and 18 years for women. This aims to ensure that they can complete their education before they get married. Some other key elements are a ban on polygamy, child marriage, triple talaq and a uniform process for divorce. The Code will not apply to Scheduled Tribes. The new law aims to ensure equality among communities in terms of inheritance rights. The UCC also recognises children born out of live-in relationships as a \"legitimate child of the couple\" and ensures that they get equal rights in inheritance. Both sons and daughters will be referred to as \"child\", omitting any gender differences. The Uniform Civil Code bans practices that some sections of Muslims follow when a woman loses her husband or gets divorced, including nikah halala and iddat. Judge-Led Panel, Special Assembly Session A government-appointed panel, led by retired Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai, had drafted a four-volume, 749-page report containing several recommendations on the UCC. The panel collected 2.33 lakh pieces of written feedback online and organised more than 70 public forums. During these meetings, panel members engaged with roughly 60,000 people to help develop the Bill draft. These recommendations, aimed at fostering gender equality and social cohesion, were deliberated upon during a special four-day Assembly session in February last year. Portal Launched For UCC Implementation An online portal has been launched by the Uttarakhand government which will be available for use by the citizens to register marriages, divorces, succession rights, live-in relationships, and their termination. These processes can be carried out from mobile phones or desktops and the progress of application can be checked through email or SMS. UCC A Major Pitch For 2024 Lok Sabha Elections Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the Code is \"an offering made by our state in the great 'yagya' being performed by the Prime Minister to make the country a developed, organised, harmonious and self-reliant nation\". However, the UCC was a major poll plank ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said during a rally in Madhya Pradesh that the BJP-led government at the Centre will implement it in the country as it is a guarantee of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and accused the Congress of advocating personal laws. Mr Modi, too, had said that UCC is already in place in the state of Goa and everyone is living happily there. He further asserted that even the Indian Constitution has mentioned the implementation of UCC. Civil Code In Goa Since Portuguese Rule A version of the UCC in place in Goa is the Portuguese Civil Code of 1867. Under this, people belonging to all religions in Goa are subject to the same laws on matters like marriage, divorce and succession. Notably, Goa was under Portugese control till 1961. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant had said in an interview to NDTV that the entire country should welcome the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) as it will bring equality between men and women. He said the entire point of the UCC is to do away with old rules and ways that are no longer compatible with a progressive society. \"We should welcome the UCC. The young, educated crowd understands that the UCC is necessary,\" Mr Sawant told NDTV. Goa continued to follow the code even after its liberation. On the other hand, Uttarakhand brought the B...",

Praggnanandhaa but he \"does not touch other women due to religious reasons.\" Press Trust of India Updated: January 27, 2025 10:56 am IST Read Time: 3 min facebook twitter WhatsApp reddit E-mail Uzbek GM refused to shake hand with Indian chess player Vaishali © X (Twitter) Grandmaster Nodirbek Yakubboev's refusal to shake hands with Indian GM R Vaishali stirred up a controversy at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament before the Uzbek apologised, saying that he meant no disrespect and didn't respond to the gesture because of \"religious reasons\". In a video shared by ChessBase India on social media, Vaishali can be seen extending her hand before the start of a fourth-round contest against Yakubboev, who sat down without responding to it, leaving the Indian visibly awkward. Yakubboev, 23, who became a GM in 2019, lost the match and is currently on three points after eight rounds in the Challengers' section. Once the short video went viral, Yakubboev posted a lengthy response on 'X' saying, he had all the respect for Vaishali and her younger brother R. Praggnanandhaa but he \"does not touch other women due to religious reasons.\" \"I want to explain the situation that happened in the game with Vaishali. With all due respect to women and Indian chess players, I want to inform everyone that I do not touch other women for religious reasons,\" wrote Yakubboev, who is a practising Muslim. 3) 2. What I did before (referring to the game with Divya in 2023 and cases like that) I consider it wrong for me. 3. I do what I need to do. I do not insist others not to shake hands with the opposite gender or for women to wear hijab or burqa. It is their business what to do. — Nodirbek Yakubboev (@NodirbekYakubb1) January 26, 2025 Vaishali did not offer her hand after beating the Uzbek player. The Indian is on four points after eight rounds with five more to go. \"I respect Vaishali and her brother as the strongest chess players in India. If I have offended her with my behavior, I apologise. I have some additional explanations: 1. Chess is not haram,\" Yakubboev wrote. \"I do what I need to do. I do not insist others not to shake hands with the opposite gender or for women to wear hijab or burqa. It is their business what to do,\" he explained.

However, he was seen shaking hands with other female players earlier. pic.twitter.com/fGR61wvwUP — Ayushh (@ayushh_it_is) January 27, 2025 Yakubboev said that in order to avoid such a situation in the eighth-round game against Romania's Irina Bulmaga, he informed her in advance about his religious beliefs. Listen to the latest songs , only on JioSaavn.com \"Today (Sunday) I told Irina Bulmaga about it. She agreed to it. But when I came to the playing hall, the arbiters told me that I should at least do Namaste as a gesture. In the games with Divya and Vaishali I couldn't tell them about it before the game and there was an awkward situation,\" he added.

Edited by: Sanstuti Nath (with inputs from AFP) World News Jan 26, 2025 21:12 pm IST Published On Jan 26, 2025 18:06 pm IST Last Updated On Jan 26, 2025 21:12 pm IST Read Time: 4 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Luis Antonio Rodrigues Santos is welcomed by Eliana Campos after being deported from US. Rio de Janeiro: The Brazil government has expressed outrage and said it would demand an explanation from the Donald Trump administration, after dozens of immigrants who were deported from the United States, arrived by plane in handcuffs. Brazil's Foreign Ministry said the treatment meted to immigrants during the fight home was a \"flagrant disregard\" of human rights. The controversy comes as Latin America grapples with US President Donald Trump's hard-line anti-immigration agenda. Since returning to power a week ago, Trump has implemented his crackdown plans on irregular migration and mass deportations, with several planes flying in illegal immigrants to different countries like Guatemala and Brazil. When one such plane landed in Brazil's northern city of Manaus, authorities reportedly found that 88 Brazilians who were aboard the aircraft, were in handcuffs. They ordered US officials to \"immediately remove the handcuffs,\" Brazil's justice ministry said in a statement. Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski told President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of \"the flagrant disregard for the fundamental rights of Brazilian citizens,\" the statement said. 🇧🇷🇺🇸BRAZIL SLAMS HANDCUFFS ON DEPORTEES—TRUMP ADMIN UNMOVED Brazil called the use of handcuffs on deportees \"blatant disrespect,\" demanding their removal mid-flight during an unexpected landing in Manaus.

The American Nightmare Among the Brazilians who were on the flight was Edgar Da Silva Moura, a 31-year-old computer technician. Before being deported, he was in detention in the United States for seven months. \"On the plane, they didn't give us water, we were tied hands and feet, they wouldn't even let us go to the bathroom (sic),\" he told news agency AFP. \"It was very hot, some people fainted,\" Moura said. Twenty-one-year-old Luis Antonio Rodrigues Santos, who was also on the flight, recounted the \"nightmare\" of people with \"respiratory problems\" during \"four hours without air conditioning\" due to technical issues on the plane. \"Things have already changed (with Trump), immigrants are treated as criminals,\" he said. The flight was originally destined for the southeastern city of Belo Horizonte but encountered a technical issue forcing it to land in Manaus. Flight Not Part Of Trump's Plan A government source told AFP the deportation flight was not directly linked to any immigration orders issued by Trump upon taking office but rather stemmed from a 2017 bilateral agreement. Brazil's Minister of Human Rights, Macae Evaristo, told journalists that \"children with autism ... who went through very serious experiences\" were also on the flight. Footage on Brazilian television showed some passengers descending from the civilian aircraft, with their hands handcuffed and their ankles shackled. \"Upon learning of the situation, President Lula ordered that a Brazilian Air Force (FAB) aircraft be mobilized to transport the Brazilians to their final destination, in order to ensure that they could complete their journey with dignity and safety,\" the justice ministry said. A Brazilian government source told AFP that the deportees who arrived in Manaus travelled \"with their documents\", which shows that they agreed to return home. Trump's Immigration Crackdown Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigration during the election campaign and began his second term with a flurry of executive actions aimed at overhauling entry to the United States. On his first day in office, he signed orders declaring a \"national emergency\" at the southern US border and announced the deployment of more troops to the area while vowing to deport \"criminal aliens.\" Several deportation flights since Monday have garnered public and media attention, though such actions were also common under previous US presidents. In a break with prior practice, however, the Trump administration has begun using military aircraft for repatriation flights, with at least one landing in Guatemala this week. The United States also expelled 265 migrants to Guatemala on Friday. There are an estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States, according to the De...",

He is like a child, and that hurts me. It makes me feel worried. I would not even leave a friend, but he is more than that. I remember there were moments when I would just walk away. But then I would be worried: Has he eaten or not? Is he on the bed properly? Is he okay? Then I had to check on him, and I would understand that he needed me,\" she said.

        "full_content": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s recent order to pause foreign aid is expected to halt funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), potentially disrupting life-saving treatments for millions of people around the world. According to CBS News which cited two sources familiar with the situation, the stoppage could lead to delays in the delivery of anti-retroviral medications (ARVs), which are essential for HIV treatment. While it remains uncertain whether local stockpiles of ARVs can make up for the disruption, the delay has raised concerns among public health advocates about the continuity of care for the millions relying on the program. CBS News has learned that PEPFAR has provided ARVs to over 20 million people across 55 countries, and the potential pause could endanger this critical support. Potential pause and growing concerns Sources say, as per the news report, that while funding could be restored following a 90-day review , advocates are worried about the future of PEPFAR. Recently, reports surfaced indicating that some organisations receiving US aid had performed abortions, which directly violates US law, the news report stated. PEPFAR’s global impact The PEPFAR program, established during President George W. Bush’s administration, is credited with saving millions of lives globally. According to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the program has provided billions of dollars to combat HIV/AIDS, helping to stem the tide of the global epidemic. Trump’s criticism of US foreign aid spending On Saturday, President Donald Trump reiterated his criticism of the US approach to foreign aid. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump called for other wealthy nations to increase their contributions to global aid efforts, particularly in relation to programs like PEPFAR. \"We're like a one-way street so we want other people to help us and we want other people to join us. We are spending billions and billions and billions of dollars and other countries that are wealthy are spending zero,\" Trump said, suggesting that the US should not bear the full burden of international humanitarian efforts. US freezes foreign aid amid policy review The US State Department issued a \"stop-work\" order on Friday (January 24) for all existing foreign assistance, halting new aid disbursements following an executive order by President Donald Trump to review US foreign policy. The move threatens to cut off billions of dollars in life-saving aid globally, with the US being the largest donor of foreign assistance. Rubio has, however, approved waivers for emergency food assistance, particularly to aid the ongoing humanitarian efforts in Gaza and Sudan. Despite this, experts warn that stopping essential services like nutrition programs and health care could cause significant harm, especially to vulnerable populations. Implications for vital programs The aid pause has already affected key programs. A USAID official confirmed that work in Ukraine, including health and educational support, has been halted. Emergency services such as maternal care, childhood vaccinations, and health assistance are among the services at risk of being suspended. Furthermore, the disruption threatens to affect programs in Gaza, Syria, Sudan, and other regions facing humanitarian crises. Military assistance exemptions While most foreign aid is frozen, military financing for Israel and Egypt continues under the approved waivers.",

Responding to an ICE update on recent arrests, the teacher wrote, “Come to Fort Worth, TX to Northside High School. I have many students who don’t even speak English and they are in 10th-11th grade. They have to communicate through their iPhone translator with me. The [U.S. Department of Education] should totally overhaul our school system in Texas too.” District takes action The Fort Worth Independent School District (FWISD) quickly launched an investigation into the matter. Roxanne Martinez, President of the School Board, assured parents that the district is addressing the situation with urgency. “Please be assured that we are taking this situation very seriously and are committed to resolving it as quickly as possible,” Martinez said. The district also announced that the substitute teacher would not return to the classroom while the review is underway. ICE operations in schools The incident comes amid heightened tensions over immigration enforcement. President Donald Trump recently issued a directive permitting ICE operations in “sensitive areas” such as schools and churches, a move that has drawn criticism from many. This policy shift follows the Biden administration’s term, during which an estimated 8 million migrants entered the US illegally, as per reports. Trump has also proposed deploying 10,000 troops to secure the US-Mexico border , escalating his administration’s immigration crackdown. Trump administration intensifies immigration crackdown The Trump administration has ramped up its immigration crackdown, with multi-agency raids underway in Chicago targeting illegal immigrants. Vice President JD Vance endorsed raids on schools and religious buildings, citing the need to protect public safety. Vance hoped they would have a \"chilling effect on illegal immigrants coming to our country.\" \"If you have a person who is convicted of a violent crime, whether they are an illegal immigrant or not, you have to go and get that person to protect the public safety,\" he said. Border Czar Tom Homan called for urgent congressional funding, requesting 100,000 detention beds to support mass deportations . He hinted at broader targets, including high-school-aged individuals linked to gangs, and promised deportations would steadily increase. ICE, he added, will operate on a \"case-by-case basis\" at sensitive locations. Homan implied that high-school-aged children could be linked to gangs and seen as valid targets. He added that deportations would \"gradually rise\" as the administration expanded its focus to include all individuals in the country illegally, not just those with criminal records.

        "full_content": "Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, recently pointed out a fascinating economic phenomenon in the world of AI on his X account. Nadella posted, “Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of.” What is theJevons Paradox? TheJevons paradox, as described by Nadella, is the idea that technological progress that makes a resource cheaper or more efficient to use often leads to an increase in demand for that resource. In the case of AI, as systems become more powerful and accessible, it is likely that their use will grow significantly. This could turn AI into a commodity that’s in higher demand than ever before, as more industries and individuals adopt it to perform a wider variety of tasks. While the increased efficiency of AI has many advantages, Nadella's mention of the Jevons paradox points to an interesting side effect. As AI performs more tasks and becomes more widely used, the demand for energy to power these systems could rise, potentially increasing overall consumption. This paradox suggests that making AI more accessible could unintentionally lead to higher resource use, as the tasks it performs expand alongside its availability. (This is a developing story.

        "summary": "The Trump administration ramped up immigration enforcement, allowing raids on schools and churches. Immigration czar Tom Homan defended the policy, citing consequences for illegal entry. Chicago saw 956 arrests in a single day, a record for ICE operations.",
        "full_content": "The Trump administration’s immigration czar, Tom Homan, on Sunday defended the controversial decision to allow raids on schools and churches, citing the need for strict enforcement of immigration laws. “There’s consequences of entering the country illegally. If we don’t show there’s consequences, you’re never going to fix the border problem,” Homan told ABC News. The decision, part of President Donald Trump’s broader immigration overhaul, has sparked widespread criticism, particularly from religious leaders and Democratic lawmakers. Chicago: Over 950 arrested in one day In Chicago, a Democratic stronghold and sanctuary city, six federal agencies launched joint operations targeting what they described as “potentially dangerous criminal aliens.” On Sunday alone, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported 956 arrests—the largest single-day total since Trump’s second-term inauguration. This marked a sharp increase compared to the agency’s daily average of 310 arrests during the 2024 fiscal year, according to ICE data. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stated that the state would assist in apprehending individuals accused of violent crimes but emphasized the need to protect law-abiding citizens. “We will defend law-abiding residents from improper enforcement actions,” Pritzker told CNN. Democratic Senators condemn raids Illinois Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth issued a joint statement Sunday criticising the raids, saying they “go far beyond” targeting dangerous individuals. “We stand with the immigrant community in Chicago and across the country, and our offices and caseworkers are ready to help those improperly caught up in these raids,” the senators said. Faith leaders criticise raids on ‘sacred spaces’ Religious organisations voiced strong opposition to the policy changes allowing raids at sensitive locations like churches and schools. Leaders from three Catholic organisations issued a statement condemning the rule change, saying it turns places of care into “places of fear and uncertainty.” When asked about this backlash, Homan dismissed the criticism, saying, “We’re enforcing laws Congress enacted and the president signed. If they don’t like it, change the law.” VP Vance accuses church groups of financial motives Vice President JD Vance took aim at the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, accusing the group of prioritizing financial concerns over humanitarian issues. “When they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants , are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?” Vance said during an interview with CBS.. Also Read | Immigrants chained and handcuffed: Trump kicks off deportation operation | Pics Call for increased funding and resources Homan highlighted the need for additional funding to sustain the ramped-up deportation efforts , including a request for 100,000 more ICE detention beds. “We’re going to try to be efficient. But with more money we have, the more we can accomplish,” he said. As Trump’s immigration policies take center stage in his second term , the nation remains divided over their impact on public safety, civil rights, and humanitarian principles.

        "full_content": "The implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in Uttarakhand has sparked widespread discussion, particularly about its impact on individuals in live-in relationships as new rules come into effect. After the implementation of the UCC, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said that registration of live-in relationships are mandatory. He added that the registrar will give the information of the couple to their parents. He said, “Children born through live-in relationships will also be considered to have equal rights in property. In this law, registration for live-in relationships has been made mandatory.\" \"The registrar will give the information of the couple to their parents, this information will be kept completely confidential.” What does the Uniform Civil Code on live-in relationship say? 1. It is mandatory for partners in a heterosexual live-in relationship within the state, whether they are residents of Uttarakhand or not , to submit a statement of live-in relationship to the registrar. 2. Residents of Uttarakhand living in a live-in relationship outside the state may submit a declaration of their live-in relationship. 3. Partners in a live-in relationship need to submit a statement of live-in relationship to the registrar. 4. Failing to register themselves as live-in partners, they will have to face punishment. The punishment for non-registration is a three-month jail term or a fine. 5. The legislation states that a delay of even a month in registration or providing false information could result in punishment. The punishment would be a jail term of up to six months and a fine of ₹ 25,000. 6. Children born through live-in relationships will also be considered to have equal rights in property. How the Uttarakhand government implemented the UCC? The UCC aims to govern laws on marriage, relationship, divorces, successions , inheritance and related matters. As soon as Pushkar Singh Dhami formed the government again in March 2022, the state cabinet at its very first meeting chaired by him cleared a proposal for the formation of an expert committee to draft it. An expert committee headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Ranjana Prakash Desai was constituted on May 27, 2022, to prepare the draft of the UCC. The panel headed by Desai submitted a comprehensive draft of the UCC prepared after a prolonged dialogue with a cross-section of people to the state government on February 2, 2024. A legislation on it was passed a few days later by the state Assembly on February 7. It was given president's assent nearly a month later paving the way for its implementation. An expert committee submitted its report to the state government late last year. The state cabinet gave its approval to the report recently and authorised the chief minister to decide a date for its implementation. The UCC was then implemented in Uttarakhand on January 27, 2025.

While waiting many insisted for a selfie.” Also Read | Ola Electric Share Price Highlights :  Ola Electric closed today at  ₹67.99, down -4.76% from yesterday’s  ₹71.39 Describing the situation further, he said that long queue of all high-end cars patiently waited behind Ola taxi while he made a swift and efficient move with his choice. \"Long queue. All high-end cars of Rich are behind the OLA patiently. When I sat in OLA it shocked all. When you are tall. Be cool. Be frugal. Be humble. Rich and famous also respected. EMI gets high-end cars and an artificial high. But OLA gets you peace for sure,\" the post adds.

He emphasised simplicity over materialism with this humble gesture. The viral post amassed over 1.75 crore views. 1.7 thousand likes and several comments. Netizens were abuzz following Velumani's preference of simplicity over luxury. A user pointed to the CEO's conflicting philosophy and practise, “Why go to 5 star if he wants to be frugal? Doesnt the same logic of a car choice apply to food too? Just curious.” Another user remarked, \"True luxury isn't about the wheels; it's about the mindset. Humility and peace will always outrun any high-end car.\" Also Read | No pricing bias for iPhone users, says Ola and Uber amid allegations A third user stated, “Dr. Velumani can even take an OLA auto to a five-star hotel, and it will be seen as admirable simplicity because he is Dr. Velumani, a successful entrepreneur. But if a genuinely middle-class person does the same, they'll be met with judgmental stares, as if they're there for a free AC experience. Society romanticizes simplicity in the rich but devalues it in the poor, exposing a deep-rooted hypocrisy in how we perceive wealth and worth.” A fourth user commented, “So I do not own a car, driving is a pain in Mumbai, parking double pain, why take this headache when we just need our body to be moved from 1 place to another, can move in own car or rental does not matter.” Praising the CEO, a user wrote, \"Very glad to hear leaders walking the talk on simple living and high thinking Indeed Ola makes life easy on mobility aspect.\" Known for frugal travel habits, Dr Arokiaswamy Velumani recounted his experience of taking a local train in Mumbai previously, which saved him 52 minutes compared to traveling by car.",

Last week, opposition MPs wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to voice their concerns, saying Pal was trying to “steamroll” the Waqf Amendment Bill through, with one eye on the February 5 Delhi Assembly election.

Opponents say these amendments are intended to diminish the ‘arbitrary’ authority of the Waqf Boards.

This initiative, aimed at supporting the world’s largest religious gathering, is a top priority for the consumer affairs ministry. It has allocated 30 tonnes of chana dal, 10 tonnes of whole chana, and 5 tonnes each of masur dal and moong dal to cater to the needs of the devotees, according to one of the officials mentioned. The Mahakumbh , a religious event of immense significance occurring after a gap of 144 years, has already attracted over 100 million devotees and visitors. This grand congregation, known for its deep spiritual and cultural importance, is expected to draw a staggering 450 million people from across the globe. The Bharat brand offers substantial discounts on staples like chana dal, whole chana, moong dal, whole moong, and masur dal at the Mahakumbh, with sales continuing until February 28. As part of the Bharat Dal scheme, pulses are being sold by NCCF at subsidized rates to ensure affordability.

They cook meals for themselves and others, so we hope it will provide some price relief and ensure the availability of pulses,\" said the second person. India's inflation battle Pulses like moong, masur, and chickpeas are pivotal in shaping India’s food inflation trends. While price pressures eased in October, demand for these protein-rich staples continues to surpass production. India’s pulse output increased to 24.5 million tonnes in FY24 from 16.3 million tonnes in FY16, yet it falls short of the growing demand of approximately 27 million tonnes. Retail inflation eased a bit to a four-month low of 5.22% in December 2024 from 5.5% in November 2024, with food inflation cooling marginally from 9.04% in November to 8.4% last month, statistics ministry data showed. The Bharat Dal scheme was introduced last year to offer pulses at cheaper prices when inflation in the category had soared to double digits. The first phase was rolled out in July last year due to lower gram (chana) production and ended in June 2024. The second phase began in October this year. Also read: Bharat Dal, coming soon to an online grocer near you The production of gram (chana), a major contributor to India’s pulses basket, declined to 11 million tonnes in FY24 from 12.2 million tonnes in FY23 and 13.5 million tonnes in FY22, according to data from the ministry of agriculture.

The Abhishek Lodha-promoted Macrotech Developers Ltd earlier this month filed a suit in the HC against Abhinandan Lodha’s real estate firm, House of Abhinandan Lodha, claiming the name ‘Lodha’ was their trademark and no one else could use it. related stories The suit sought Rs 5,000 crore as damages from Abhinandan Lodha’s company. In an interim application, Macrotech Developers sought a perpetual injunction against the defendants from infringing their trademark ‘Lodha’. On Monday, a single bench of Justice Arif Doctor while hearing the application said since the dispute was primarily between two brothers, the possibility of an amicable resolution should be attempted. “Ultimately it appears to be a dispute between two brothers. The genesis appears to be between the two brothers. Has some effort been made to sit down and resolve it?\" Justice Doctor said. The court asked the parties concerned (Macrotech Developers, Abhinandan Lodha and Abhishek Lodha) to inform it on Tuesday if they were willing to resolve the matter by way of mediation. The HC said if the parties were agreeable, then it would appoint a former chief justice or a retired Supreme Court judge as the mediator and an endeavour shall be made to complete the proceedings as expeditiously as possible. Senior counsel Darius Khambata, appearing for Macrotech Developers, told the court that the plaintiff company was the registered proprietor of the trademark ‘Lodha’, and hence it was the aggrieved party. The high court, however, noted that the genesis appears to be from a dispute between the brothers. “If the dispute between the brothers is resolved, then would it not put to rest everything else? There has to be some effort made for a resolution,\" the HC said. The Lodha brothers, sons of BJP leader and Maharashtra cabinet minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha, had reached a settlement in 2015. Macrotech Developers, in its application, claimed it was the flagship company of the Lodha Group, a leading real estate developer founded in the early 1980s, offering residential and commercial properties under the brand name Lodha. It further claimed that the plaintiff company was the proprietor of the trademark ‘Lodha’ and various other registered trademarks containing the name as the leading, essential and prominent feature. As per the application, until 2015, there was an internal agreement that all companies in the Lodha Group could use the trademark. However, in 2015, it was decided that Abhinandan Lodha would separate from the Lodha Group and start his own business. The terms of separation were also recorded by way of a Family Settlement Agreement in March 2017 and another agreement in 2023, wherein it was decided that the defendant’s venture would be called The House of Abhinandan Lodha. The plaintiff company claimed it was not part of the 2023 agreement and was not bound by the terms. “The plaintiff company, who is the registered proprietors of the ‘Lodha’ trademarks, has neither in the past nor till date hereof granted any no-objection/permission to the defendants for the use of ‘House of Abhinandan Lodha’,\" the application said. Abhishek Lodha, who helms the flagship company of the group, Macrotech Developers, in the suit, claimed the “Lodha\" brand name was built over the last four decades, and his firm spent Rs 1,700 crore in brand-building in a decade alone. The suit said the Lodha name commands a lot of goodwill, and Macrotech’s domestic property sales alone stand at Rs 91,000 crore over the last decade. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “The Lodha Group has spent considerable time, effort and money building its brand through advertisements and endorsements and is renowned across India and abroad,\" it added.

(Getty) The Supreme Court has quashed criminal proceedings initiated for an offense of dowry harassment against a man and his family members through his ex-wife, stating that she failed to abide by the terms of the settlement for dissolution of marriage that she would not seek any action in the matter. A bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Prashant Kumar Mishra allowed an appeal filed by Vedant Shukla and set aside the Madhya Pradesh High Court’s order which declined to quash the proceedings under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. related stories As per facts of the matter, the marriage of the parties was solemnised on February 12, 2011, as per Hindu rites and ceremonies. There were no children born from the wedlock. Due to the marital discord between the parties, an FIR was registered with Mahila Police Thana, Bhopal, for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 506 & 34 of Indian Penal Code. The complaint was filed by the wife on October 15, 2020, alleging cruelty and criminal intimidation on the part of the husband, mother-in-law and sister-in-law. Meanwhile, due to the mediation by relatives, friends and in-laws, there was a settlement between the parties and a joint petition under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act was filed on January 9, 2021, before the court concerned and after the due process, as her statement was recorded on September 9, 2021, their marriage was dissolved by decree of divorce on September 13, 2021.

He said nothing further happened in the case and even charges have not been framed as of now. Meanwhile, in the joint petition filed in the Family Court at Bhopal, where petitioner No. 1 is the wife, it was inter-alia recorded that both the parties agree that the complaint filed by the petitioner No. 1 under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code 1860 should be resolved on or before the finalisation of this particular petition. Thereafter, the statement of the wife was also recorded on September 9, 2021, which inter-alia reads as: “I had lodged a report of dowry harassment against Vedant Shukla and his family in the Mahila Police Station Bhopal, I will not take any action in that matter in the concerned competent forum/Court.\" Since the respondent-wife did not comply with the undertaking, a petition was filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the appellant No. 1 before the high court, bringing all the relevant facts for quashing the proceedings. Nevertheless, the said petition of the appellant No. 1 was dismissed by the high court for the reason given by the judge: “I am of the considered view that a criminal case under Sections 498A, 506 & 34 of the IPC cannot be quashed merely on the basis of a statement recorded in Family Court in a petition for mutual divorce by the parties.\" The apex court bench, however, said: “Be that as it may, we have gone through the FIR, apart from making their statement regarding demand of dowry criminal intimidation etc, there are no details of such an incident.\" top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The court noted the counsel for the appellants relied upon the judgment of this court in the cases of “Ruchi Agarwal Vs Amit Kumar Agrawal & Ors (2005) and in “Mohd Shamim & Ors Vs Nahid Begum (Smt) & Anr (2005) where on the similar conduct of the wife, criminal proceedings were indeed quashed.

With the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) recently unearthing a hidden tunnel built for smuggling of drugs along the Mizoram-Myanmar international border, News18 has exclusively accessed an intelligence report on how the illegal trade has become a “shadow economy\". Intelligence sources called it a “global nexus\", which helps drugs from Mizoram reach Bangladesh, Nepal, and Southeast Asia via Assam and Manipur. related stories Sources said the India-Myanmar shadow economy is worth Rs 30,000-40,000 crore. THE ROUTE Mizoram and Myanmar have more than 500-km-long porous border, which is surrounded by dense forest, river and difficult terrain, which make surveillance impossible. Moreover, only 10% is fenced. First, the drug cartels use the Champhai district of Mizoram to enter India due to proximity to Tiau river. The second choice is Zokhawthar, a village close to the border. The third is Siaha and Lawngtlai districts, which are remote areas with limited surveillance. These are used to move drugs to Assam and beyond. From India, shipments move to Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Middle-East. These drugs are transported by locals, fake components in trucks, bamboo logs and food supplies such as rice sacks. WHAT GOES WHERE? Methamphetamine is supplied to India, Thailand and Australia. Heroin is produced and sent to Europe via Iran and Africa. Fentanyl and ketamine is sent to the Chinese market. Meth is transported via river networks to Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam They are using private planes and even fishing boats for bulk shipments to Australia, Japan, and the U.S. THE BUSINESS The drug cartels are using inventions to make profit. A case in point, the trade of synthetic drugs for higher profits. “Traffickers are shifting to fentanyl and methamphetamine crystals for higher profits. Huge profit margins are helping Myanmar and smugglers in India multiply it. A yaba tablet costing Rs 10 in Myanmar sells for Rs 500-1,000 in Mizoram. Myanmar produces heroin worth Rs 20,000 crore, of which 80% comes to India,\" said sources. THE ROLE OF ARMED GROUPS “Even heavy vehicles can pass the drug tunnel found along the Mizoram-Myanmar international border during the DRI raid,\" said sources. Another alarming issue is the collaboration between traffickers and Myanmar-based armed groups like Chin National Army to protect the tunnels. “The Myanmar United Wa State Army makes Rs 20,000 crore annually from Indian market and even has properties and luxury investments in Delhi and Mumbai,\" said sources. United Wa State Army (UWSA) operates methamphetamine labs and produces 80% of South East Asia Meth, Yana Tablet and crystal meth and is supported and protected by Junta. The Shan State Army (SSA) is involved in heroin production and their nexus is mainly Thai and the Chinese. People’s Militia Forces are now control drug labs in Chin and Kachin States and they are using this money to fund weapons. Their global nexus is ranging from India to Australia, Africa, Iran and Europe. CRISIS ACROSS THE GLOBE According to sources, these groups have huge investments abroad and are involved in money laundering. These smugglers have cryptocurrencies (e.g. bitcoin) and shell companies in Singapore/Thailand. They also have huge investments in real estate, casinos such as KK Park in Myanmar-Thai border. These drugs have caused addiction crises in Thailand, Laos, and Malaysia. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Heroin and meth from UWSA labs are driving epidemics in Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland.

(Representational Image: Shutterstock) In a case involving a shocking ‘betrayal of blood and trust’, the Allahabad High Court has denied bail to an accused who allegedly along with his father raped his sister, resulting in her pregnancy. The bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh said, “It is a case of an unforgivable betrayal of blood and trust. The hands of father and brother meant to protect the dignity of his daughter and sister became weapons of her destruction.\" The accused namely Pramod, sought relief under Section 439 of the CrPC. The charges against him included rape, assault, and criminal intimidation under Sections 376, 323, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code. related stories The victim had filed an FIR in March 2019, alleging that both her brother (the applicant) and her father had been subjecting her to sexual abuse for 3-4 years. She also revealed that her attempts to report the abuse were met with threats, and her pregnancy, confirmed to be five months along at the time, resulted from the assaults. The situation escalated to a breaking point when she courageously reported the matter through the women’s helpline number, 1090. The applicant’s counsel argued that Pramod was falsely implicated and had been languishing in jail since April 2019.

The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, was referred to the joint committee of Parliament on August 8 following its introduction in the Lok Sabha by Union Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju. The Bill aims to amend the Waqf Act of 1995, to address issues and challenges in regulating and managing Waqf properties. related stories Speaking to reporters, JPC chairman Jagdambika Pal said a meeting was held for a clause-by-clause review and opposition members had proposed amendments over 44 clauses. “The kind of amendments passed today… I believe a better bill will be prepared,\" he said.

However, all amendments moved by opposition members in 44 clauses were defeated through a vote. “After detailed discussions over the course of 6 months, we sought amendments from all members.

Meanwhile, opposition MPs decried the proceedings and accused Pal of “subverting\" the democratic process. “It was a farcical exercise. We were not heard. Pal has acted in a dictatorial manner,\" Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee told reporters. Pal rejected the charge, and said the entire exercise was democratic, and the majority view prevailed. “I asked all members whether they are moving the amendments. They said they will be moving the amendments. There can’t be anything more democratic than this. They also approved of some amendments proposed by NDA,\" he said. BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi also defended Pal, saying the meeting was held in a democratic manner and the JPC chairman tried to hear everybody out and gave sufficient time for everybody to move the amendment that everybody wished to. Some objections of the Opposition in unanimity included the clause to amend the short title of the Act from the ‘Waqf Act, 1995’ to ‘Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act, 1995’ (UMEED). The leaders have questioned the government’s intent to rename the Bill which, according to them, was not required. Both the ruling alliance and opposition members proposed more than 500 amendments to the 44 clauses of the bill. Opposition members have strongly opposed separate Waqf boards for specific sects like the Aga Khanis and Shias. Tensions were running high as 10 opposition MPs were suspended for a day on Friday after they accused Pal of bias and created a ruckus.

(Representational Image: Shutterstock) The Supreme Court has emphasised the need for both parents to cooperate and communicate effectively to ensure the smooth implementation of the visitation arrangement in a child custody matter, saying mutual respect and collaboration are essential for the child’s well-being. A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Prasanna B Varale refused a plea by a woman to allow her to be present during the visitation meetings of 13-year-old daughter with her father that will take place during the pendency of this petition. “But we understand the concerns of a mother of a teenage daughter, especially one who has made serious allegations against her husband. Thus, as urged by her that the safety of the child be ensured and as suggested by the respondent, we deem it appropriate that a court appointed commissioner, who should be a female, should be present at all times during the visitation meetings,\" the bench said. related stories The court felt such an arrangement strikes a fair balance between the child’s need for stability, her safety and welfare, and the respondent’s right to meaningful involvement in the child’s life. “Both parents are reminded of their duty to prioritise the child’s welfare and work collaboratively to create a nurturing and supportive environment for the child,\" the bench said. The woman challenged the Chhattisgarh High Court’s order of May 11, 2022, granting certain, specified visitation rights to the respondent – father in his appeal against dismissal of his petition seeking custody of the child before the Family Court, Durg. The petitioner and respondent were married on January 16, 2007 and out of this wedlock, the daughter was born in 2012. During the separation between the parties since 2016, the child has resided with the mother who has been the primary caregiver and custodian. She claimed to have provided a stable, nurturing environment conducive to the child’s emotional, educational, and overall well-being. On the other hand, the respondent father has consistently maintained that he has the intention and willingness to actively contribute to the child’s upbringing and seeks a greater role in shaping the child’s life. The Family Court granted sole custody of the child to the mother and the respondent was awarded limited visitation rights — restricted to one and a half hours on the first Sunday of every month and certain holidays. Aggrieved by the limited visitation rights, the respondent appealed to the High Court, seeking joint custody or an extended visitation schedule. The High Court, after a comprehensive review of the evidence, agreed to retain sole custody with the mother but expanded the father’s visitation rights. It allowed longer meeting hours, physical meetings on a fortnight basis, shared vacation time, and regular video calls to promote a meaningful bond between the father and the child. Citing concerns about the child’s safety and emotional stability, the mother approached the Supreme Court. She contended extended visitation schedule disrupts the child’s routine and could negatively impact her academic performance and extracurricular activities. She also highlighted the respondent’s alleged history of abusive behaviour, criminal charges, and past incidents of conflict during visitation, asserting that these factors make the expanded schedule inappropriate and unsafe for the child. Conversely, the respondent father defended the High Court’s ruling, asserting that the expanded visitation arrangement is in the child’s best interest. He claimed that the mother has manipulated the child and influenced her views, limiting his ability to build a relationship. He argued that the revised schedule allowed him to strengthen his bond with the child, which is essential for her overall development. While keeping the issue as open, the respondent father urged for an interim arrangement to be made in order to enable him to exercise certain visitation rights, meet his daughter, and redevelop the bond that has strained over time. Allowing interim visitation rights to respondent during the pendency of the petition, the bench said, the weeklong and overnight stays cannot be allowed in the interim. “Since both the parties have made severe allegation against each other to bring forth their individual concerns for the physical safety and mental wellbeing of the child while in the company of the opposite parent, we will not go ...",

(News18 Tamil) Tamil documentary film Ellalan ‘s cinematographer, SR Santhosh, has recently clarified whether Seeman, the Naam Tamil Party chief coordinator, was served turtle meat during his visit to Sri Lanka in the 2000s. This comes after recent claims by Tamil film director Sankagiri Rajkumar who asserted that a photo of Seeman with Prabhakaran, the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, was fake and had been edited. related stories According to some reports, Seeman admitted to having consumed tortoise meat during a visit to the Liberal Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) camp in Sri Lanka in the 2000s when the island nation was going through a civil war. Seeman reportedly mentioned that the LTTE leaders extended great hospitality to him, serving tortoise meat as part of the meal. However, in an exclusive interview with News18 Tamil, Prabhakaran’s nephew, Karthik Manoharan, denied such claims that Seeman was served turtle meat. “It’s true that a meeting took place between myself and Seeman,\" he confirmed, “but it was brief, lasting only eight to ten minutes. Contrary to his claims, Seeman had no contact with my aunt (Prabhakaran’s wife). There was no shared meal, no turtle curry, no idli curry. These are all fabrications.\" Meanwhile, Santhosh, who accompanied Seeman on his visit to Sri Lanka to meet Prabhakaran, said in an exclusive interview to News18 Tamil, “While Seeman’s assertions may hold some truth, his comparison of LTTE fighters to five-star hotel chefs is inaccurate.\" Speaking about the hospitality offered to them in Sri Lanka, Santhosh said, “The hospitality of Eelam Tamils is beyond words. Despite their own hardships, they demonstrate remarkable generosity and care for others. Even in the midst of conflict, their willingness to share their limited resources speaks volumes about their character. The depth of their hospitality cannot be overstated; Eelam Tamils prioritise the well-being of guests, even if it means sacrificing their own comfort.\" Santhosh further added that, during his visit, he was served turtle meat, while Seeman, despite requests, was not. “I lived there for seven months and even had turtle meat. It is important to clarify that the turtle meat was not served to Seeman but to me. Despite this, he claims to have been served turtle meat.

During the 2009 war, Prabhakaran invited many Tamil nationalists from Tamil Nadu to showcase his pride, and Seeman was brought to Sri Lanka through Cheralathan, the person in charge.

(PTI) A train to Kashmir in the North and a new bridge to take a train to Rameswaram in the South — both these feats will be possible soon with Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to inaugurate the landmark projects in February. These are also the PM’s dream projects and exhibit the country’s flourishing infrastructure story amidst some big challenges. The Udhampur Srinagar Baramulla Rail Link will link the Kashmir Valley —described by the 13th century poet Amir Khusrau as ‘paradise on earth’— with the rest of the country after a wait of decades. The new Pamban Rail Bridge will re-link Rameswaram, home to the late President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, to the mainland. related stories The visuals of the trial run of the first Vande Bharat train from Katra to Srinagar last week exhibit how humungous challenges were overcome in the last decade on a 111-km stretch between Katra and Banihal to be inaugurated by Modi next month. No work had happened on this stretch till Modi first reviewed it on June 24, 2015. This was a significant date as the prime minister termed it “an important national project and asked J&K and Railways to speed up the work\". This is one of the most complex and technologically challenging stretches in the country. Of the 111-km rail line between Katra and Banihal, 97.42 km is through as many as 25 tunnels and there are 6 km of bridges. The Vande Bharat on Saturday during the trial run passed over the Chenab Rail Bridge, the world’s highest railway bridge which sits 359 meters over the Chenab River, and the Anji Khad Bridge, which is India’s first cable-stayed rail bridge. Why this explains India’s Success Story The train line to Kashmir will be an engineering marvel that would rival the most challenging projects in the world — it has a total of 38 tunnels, one of them nearly 13 km long, and 931 bridges. The commitment to the same by the Modi government explains a lot about the prime minister’s vision for Kashmir. Despite a year-round tourism industry, the Kashmir Valley historically had just a single mode of transport connecting it to the rest of India — by road. A recent study by Oxford University explained how, for years, overwhelming traffic on a National Highway, as well as shutdowns created by erratic snowstorms, served as a constant reminder of the need for an alternative source of connectivity to Kashmir. It was a four-decade-old vision to nestle a railway line within the Himalayas — traversing mountains, gorges, and ridges. February marks the culmination of this long and arduous journey that required innovative tunneling in the most treacherous terrain. The PM putting the project on the fast-track in 2015 ushered in a paradigm shift at all levels of execution and administration regarding the rail link, said the Oxford Study. The PM’s push prompted publication of weekly hindrance reports, unparalleled support given to project officials, and army convoys that escorted trucks of construction material. Former Chief Secretary of J&K Arun Mehta says the PM’s intervention galvanised the project’s execution and will be a lifeline for Kashmir’s socio-economic development. As an all-weather means of transport for an area that is snowbound for part of the year, the Kashmir rail link could open up opportunities for enhanced tourism, investments and boosting J&K’s economy. PM’s Second Gift in February The second big project on the PM’s table in February is the new Pamban Rail Bridge to Rameswaram whose foundation stone was laid by Modi in 2019 and the sea bridge is now ready for operations after a safety nod. This new bridge is replacing a bridge made by the British in 1914, which was decommissioned in 2022 as it completed its life term. The new bridge re-connects Rameswaram to the main land now after a gap of two years. The 2.07-km-long vertical lift rail bridge having two rail lines — which can be lifted up to 17 meters and closed within 10 minutes using machines — it would rival in technology the Tower Bridge of London. Train operations would be disrupted for not very long when the bridge is lifted for ships and vessels to pass through in the Bay of Bengal. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The bridge is set to accommodate heavier rail traffic and faster trains.

The fare for each devotee is Rs 100, and we also assist with their luggage.\" Just as one requires assistance to reach the summit of Vaishno Devi, the handcart operators have become a vital support system in Prayagraj. Visitors say the carts have significantly eased the journey of crossing the 2km stretch.

(Source: Reuters) A Chennai court has slapped Lufthansa Airlines with a fine of Rs 55,000 after an elderly couple filed a complaint regarding the traumatic experience they faced aboard the plane on a 10-hour journey to Frankfurt. The couple had a harrowing experience on the flight where they were forced to use wet seats with water dripping from above throughout their journey. related stories The couple – Joju Dominic, 69, and his wife Jasmine, 65 – had to face emotional and financial distress because of delays in the flights and denial of assistance, reported The Times Of India. Couple Face Harrowing Experience In Lufthansa The couple were travelling from Chennai to Vancouver via Frankfurt and had booked round-trip tickets of Lufthansa Airlines for Rs 3.5 lakh. On June 12, 2023, the couple’s troubles began as they started the journey. Their first flight from Chennai to Frankfurt was late by 90 minutes because of which they had to wait in the aerobridge. After boarding the flight, the couple found that their seats were completely wet and water was dripping from the compartment overhead. Joju said that the cabin crew did not offer any help to them and instead threatened to deplane him if he complained about the situation. “The staff blamed the issue on Chennai’s climate and suggested we use a blanket to deal with the dripping water,\" he added. After facing inconvenience for long, the couple were finally given alternative seats. The couple then missed their connecting Air Canada flight to Vancouver because of a lack of priority assistance and delays by Lufthansa Airlines. The couple had some arguments with airline staff after which the officials accommodated them on a later flight. However, the constant delays further led to the couple missing their scheduled ferry in Canada. The harrowing experience continued during the couple’s return journey. The Lufthansa Airlines, after the take-off, faced a fuel leakage and came back to Frankfurt. On October 3, 2023, the couple were asked to go to a service centre to seek help at Frankfurt airport where they were treated harshly. Lufthansa Airlines also initially denied their request for accommodation before the departure of the rescheduled flight, Joju alleged. The couple were also not provided pre-booked wheelchair assistance and were forced to walk for around 2 km to their lodging. Joju said that the meal provided after the flight was delayed was also inadequate and they also ran out of their medical supplies. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The couple sued the airlines and demanded Rs 3.5 lakh in compensation which is equal to the cost of their tickets. The court directed the airline to pay Rs 55,000 for causing mental harassment to the couple and to cover their legal costs. tags : elderly couple lufthansa airlines seats wheelchair Location : Chennai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 10:09 IST News india No Wheelchair, Wet Seats: Elderly Couple Have Harrowing Experience On Lufthansa, Airlines Faces Rs 55K Fine Read More",

Pune has been the centre of the outbreak. Every day, 28 new cases of GBS are recorded. Among the affected, 16 patients are critically ill and require ventilator support. In the wake of the outbreak, a rapid response team was formed by the Maharashtra government.

(PTI photo) As the country celebrated its 76th Republic Day on Sunday, Delhi recorded its warmest Republic Day in eight years with the maximum temperature reaching 23.7 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal.

The long-period average (LPA) maximum temperature for the day since 1991 is 22.1 degrees Celsius. However, recent years have been cooler, with temperatures of 20.6 degrees Celsius in 2024, 17.3 degrees Celsius in 2023, and 16.4 degrees Celsius in 2022. The weather department attributed the higher-than-usual temperatures to clear skies and dry northwesterly winds. “Despite a recent western disturbance bringing some rain and snow to parts of northwest India, the maximum temperature in Delhi has remained relatively unaffected due to bright daytime sunshine,\" explained Mahesh Palawat, Vice President of Skymet, a private weather monitoring agency. However, these dry conditions have caused a drop in night temperatures. Delhi’s minimum temperature on Sunday was 7.2 degrees Celsius, slightly below normal, and a drop from 8.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday and 9.8 degrees Celsius on Friday. Looking ahead, a fresh western disturbance is expected to affect the region from January 28, causing both maximum and minimum temperatures to rise. “The disturbance will shift wind patterns, reduce wind speeds and bring cloud cover, which will trap heat at night and cause night temperatures to rise,\" said Palawat. According to the IMD, the minimum temperature could rise to between 9-11 degrees Celsius by the weekend, while the maximum temperature is expected to hover between 24-26 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) worsened, moving from the ‘moderate’ (174) category on Saturday to ‘poor’ (216) on Sunday.

The UCC refers to one law that would be applicable to all religious communities in matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, maintenance etc. India has a uniform or one set of ‘criminal code’ for all its citizens but doesn’t have uniform civil law. After much debate, tribals have been kept out of the UCC ambit, and has a complete ban on practices like halala, iddat, and talaq (customs related to marriage and divorce in Muslim Personal Law). The UCC, which has 392 sections under seven schedules, is based on a 750-page draft, spread over four volumes, prepared by an expert committee formed by the government in June 2022, to examine the way the law can be introduced in the state. The five-member expert committee, headed by Retd. Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, had submitted its draft to Uttarakhand on February 2, 2024, which was subsequently passed by the State Cabinet on February 4.

(PTI photo) Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday described AAP as ‘Avaidh Aamdaniwali Party’, alleging that it did nothing but indulge in corruption and spread lies to get votes under Arvind Kejriwal’s leadership during its 10-year rule in Delhi. Addressing a public meeting in the Narela Assembly constituency, Shah also accused AAP of sheltering illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and Rohingyas. He said the BJP will free the city of such illegal immigrants if it gets the mandate in the Delhi Assembly polls. related stories “AAP’s misgovernance will come to an end on February 8, when the BJP will come to power. Kejriwal, your government is on its way out soon and the BJP is coming at the helm,\" he said. Hitting back at Shah, AAP said his speeches made it clear the BJP has conceded defeat in the Assembly polls. “He must answer what has the BJP done in the last decade to improve Delhi’s crumbling law and order. The one job they had ‘ensuring security’ has been an outright failure under Shah’s watch,\" AAP said in a statement. At the public meeting, Shah exhorted people to dislodge the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) from power to end its “misrule\", vowing that the BJP will fulfil all its poll promises, make Delhi the world’s number one capital and also free the city of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and Rohingyas. “Kejriwal only told lies to get votes… AAP means ‘Avaidh Aamdaniwali Party’ (a party which makes illegal income),\" he said on Sunday while campaigning for the BJP candidate from Narela, Raj Karan Khatri. The home minister also alleged that the AAP government under Kejriwal’s leadership indulged in corruption. “The entire Delhi is today struggling due to the supply of dirty water and waterlogging. The schools have been finished. There aren’t adequate facilities in hospitals,\" he alleged. While governance in Delhi under Kejriwal’s AAP worsened over the past 10 years, states ruled by the BJP progressed due to the party’s double-engine government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said. Shah also accused Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party of insulting Purvanchalis living in Delhi with their comments. “He called Purvanchalis fake voters. I want to ask Kejriwal if people who came from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand do not have the right to vote in Delhi,\" he said Shah said the country has “blessed\" the prime minister and made him the prime minister for the third consecutive term by reposing faith in him. It is because Modi does what he says, the BJP leader said. “Bless him once in Delhi too. Delhi will become the number one capital in the world… Make Khatri sahab (BJP candidate from Narela) victorious. The time has come for them (AAP) to go,\" Shah told the gathering. “I promise you that you make the BJP win, and within two years we will free Delhi from illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and Rohingyas,\" Shah said, as he alleged that AAP indulged in scams worth crores of rupees during its rule in Delhi. “The (former) education minister (Manish Sisodia) opened liquor shops near schools, temples and gurdwaras to spoil the younger generation, besides indulging in corruption worth crores of rupees. But at the end, both ‘Bade Miya’ (Kejriwal) and ‘Chote Miya’ (Sisodia) were put in jail,\" Shah said. He also claimed that AAP leaders not only indulged in a liquor scam, but also committed scams worth crores of rupees involving the Delhi Jal Board, ration distribution, purchase of DTC buses and construction of classrooms in schools. Attacking Kejriwal over the alleged scam in the renovation of his official bungalow when he was the chief minister, the home minister asked the gathering, “Do any of you have designer marble worth Rs 6 crore in your house, or motorised curtains worth Rs 4-6 crore, or doors worth Rs 70 lakh which opens when you clap? “Do you have a house carpet worth Rs 50 lakh, a water system installed for Rs 15 crore, recliner sofa worth Rs 10 lakh? All these things were there in ‘Sheesh Mahal’,\" he said, referring to the former chief minister’s erstwhile official residence. Shah highlighted the Modi government’s achievements and said the prime minister has started a new work culture and politics of performance for winning elections. AAP failed to fulfil its promises such as cleaning of Yamuna river, freeing Delhi from pollution and garbage, doubling beds in hospitals, 24×7 potable water supply, establishment of a sports university, and setting up of fast track courts, he claimed. “Such is the situation that it seems he (Kejriwal) is born to lie,\" Shah charged.

(PTI file photo) Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday said the district headquarters of Dibrugarh will be developed as the second capital of the state within the next three years. Unfurling the national flag here on the occasion of Republic Day, Sarma said the government will construct a permanent building of the assembly in this city on the southern bank of Brahmaputra in Upper Assam. related stories “Today is an important day in Dibrugarh’s journey to become the second capital of Assam. For the first time, state celebrations are taking place in this historical city,\" he said. From 2027, one session of Assam assembly will take place in Dibrugarh every year, the CM announced. “From January 25 next year, the construction work for a permanent building of the Assam assembly will begin. In the next three years, Dibrugarh will become an important city in India,\" he said. As part of the government’s urbanisation plan, Tezpur and Silchar will also be developed along with Dibrugarh, Sarma said. “Dibrugarh will be the second capital of Assam in the next three years. We will construct a Raj Bhavan in Tezpur and develop it as the cultural capital of Assam. Silchar will have a secretariat and chief secretary’s office, thereby bridging the gap between Barak Valley and Guwahati,\" he added. Sarma had last year opened the first CM secretariat outside the state capital in Dibrugarh town. The CM said that Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar was not part of the initial Constitution Drafting Committee. “Pandit (Jawaharlal) Nehru termed him a troublemaker and tried to keep him outside the Constitution Committee. Our Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, favoured Ambedkar due to his exceptional intellectual prowess and it proved to be the right decision to include him in the committee,\" he said. Sarma said India has a Constitution with the ethos of brotherhood and compassion, rising above narrow thinking. “Article 17 is the foundation of an open society. Ambedkar’s fight against untouchability was not only about Dalits, it was the soul of India. It inspired generations of India. Untouchability, deep-rooted in the caste system, deprived many of their fundamental rights and basic human dignity. Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar stood as a beacon of hope, striving to restore human dignity and equality of those marginalised by society,\" he said. “We are committed not to take India to the darkness of Emergency. We will take part in the journey to make India a developed nation by 2047,\" he added. Sarma said all state government employees whose recruitment process started before 2005 but got appointed finally in 2005 or later, will be included in the Old Pension Scheme (OPS). “Currently, all employees are under the National Pension System (NPS). But Assam will adopt the Unified Pension Scheme from April 2025,\" he added. Sarma said around 1.25 lakh appointments have been made in government departments since he assumed charge in May 2021, and 50,000 more recruitments will take place this year. “A new department — Department of Startups — will be established in Assam to encourage and support the entrepreneurs,\" he said. The CM said that on February 25-26, the state is organising the Advantage Assam 2.0 Summit, focussing on sectors like infrastructure, electronics, renewable energy, tourism and logistics to attract investment and drive growth. “We were a dependent state earlier and it was our identity. Now, we want to be a contributory state like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. We want to transform ourselves and that is my goal for the future of Assam,\" he said. Sarma said that Assam has moved from an era of violence to one of peace and progress. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “Once defined by gunshots at night, today the state is a symbol of tranquillity,\" he said. “The way Assam is progressing, it will be a major economic power of India in the next 10 years.

A source within the party said Nitish Kumar's son may join politics after Holi. reset Follow us on Google News Nishant Kumar's entry into politics had been floated despite the CM's objection to dynastic politics. (PTI/File) Janata Dal (United) chief and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s son Nishant Kumar is gearing up for his political debut ahead of the Assembly elections scheduled for later this year, bringing an interesting change as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has planned to contest with Nitish Kumar as the CM face once again. Party sources told The Indian Express that Nishant Kumar is likely to join active politics after Holi, following an “ever-growing demand from party workers\" for his entry into the political arena. “He seems to be ready to join politics. It is only about getting the green signal from Nitish Kumar,\" a JD(U) source was quoted as saying. related stories Nitish Kumar, who is in his 70s, is the longest-serving chief minister of Bihar. As such, Nishant’s name had been doing the rounds within the JD(U) circles over the last year, even though several leaders initially downplayed his role in politics. On January 8, Nishant was seen alongside his father in their hometown of Bakhtiyarpur to unveil the statues of freedom fighters, where he publicly urged people to bring him back in the upcoming elections. “If possible, please vote for my father and his party and give him a chance once again,\" he said, although he remained mum about his own inclusion. Who Is Nishant Kumar? Nishant Kumar was born on July 20, 1975, and is the only son of the current Bihar CM and Manju Sinha, who passed away in 2007. A software engineer and an alumnus of the Birla Institute of Technology (BIT) Mesra, Nishant Kumar, 49, has kept a relatively low profile and has stayed away from most political events. In July last year, he had rejected speculations of his entry into politics and said he had chosen the path of spirituality. However, he did attend his father’s oath-taking ceremony in 2015, after which senior JD(U) leader Shravan Kumar hinted that the younger Kumar may join politics, saying a decision would be taken at the right time. Nishant’s possible entry into politics becomes more interesting as his father, who calls himself a true disciple of the late former Bihar CM Karpuri Thakur, has been a staunch critic of dynastic politics over the years, criticised the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) for the same. In June last year, JD(U) state General Secretary Pram Hans Kumar said it was the demand of the time and the situation that Nishant Kumar came forward for the welfare of the party and the state. “Nitish Kumar opposes ‘parivarvaad’ but if a leader with a clean image has a son who wants to serve the country and the state honestly, then what is wrong with it?\" he said. Reactions To Nishant Kumar’s Political Entry Following the January 8 event, opposition parties reacted strongly to Nishant’s support for his father in the upcoming elections, saying it described Nitish Kumar’s waning mass appeal. The RJD and Congress predicted major political developments in Bihar and suggested that Nitish would want to pass on his legacy, The Times of India reported. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the JD(U) came in the defence of the CM and his son. “He (Nishant Kumar) will turn out to be a calm and far-sighted leader. People don’t know much about him because he doesn’t come much in public… Demanding Nishant Kumar in politics doesn’t mean that our party has got weak so that the party can be further strengthened and state can be developed further,\" said Hans Kumar. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The BJP also praised the work done by Nitish Kumar over the last few years and said Nishant’s statement was a rightful contribution to his father’s contributions to the state.

(ANI photo) The earlier detention of a Colaba resident in connection with the attack on Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan has resulted in him losing his job and cancellation of his marriage, according to a report in Hindustan Times. The 31-year-old Mumbai resident, identified as Akash Kailash Kanojia, was detained on January 18, two days after a horrifying attack on the actor at his Bandra residence. Kanojia was detained from Durg railway station while he was on his way back to his native place, Nehla, in Chhattisgarh from Mumbai. related stories The Colaba resident told Hindustan Times that he was travelling to Bilaspur via Jnaneswar Express on January 17 to meet his ailing grandmother and prospective bride when he was detained by railway protection force (RPF) officers at the station. This happened after an erroneous alert by Mumbai police to RPF, claiming that Kanojia was the person behind the foiled robbery attempt at actor’s Mumbai residence. Sharing the ordeal, the 31-year-old said that soon after he was nabbed, his photographs were circulated widely on TV channels and media outlets which led him to losing his job as well as suffering a setback in personal life as the bride’s family refused to meet him. “The RPF personnel not only apprehended me, they also issued a press release with my photograph, which was shown widely by television channels and media outlets. As a result, the bride’s family cancelled the meeting with me and my employer terminated my services,\" Hindustan Times quoted Kanojia as saying. Kanojia worked as a driver for a tour company which works with Western Railway in Mumbai. On January 17, he received a call from Mumbai police, which asked him about his whereabouts. When he told the officer that he was at home, the latter disconnected the call, he told Hindustan Times. “The next day, I boarded Jnaneswari Express from Mumbai hoping to visit my ailing grandmother in our native place Nehla in Chhattisgarh. I was supposed to change trains in Bilaspur to go to Nehla and was slated to meet the family of my prospective bride later,\" he told HT. On January 18, when the train reached Durg junction at around 10am, RPF personnel detained him, suspecting him to be Saif’s attacker and took him to Raipur. The Mumbai police team reached there almost 12 hours later and told him that he would be brought back to the city the following day for further probe. He told police that he had nothing to do with the attack but they didn’t listen to him. “I told the police that I had nothing to do with the attack on Saif Ali Khan and offered to make them speak with my relatives. I also told them that they could check footage from CCTVs installed near my house to clarify their doubts. But they did not pay any heed – instead, they took my photos and circulated them in the media, claiming I was the attacker,\" said Kanojia. However, the same day, police arrested Shariful Islam Shehzad, an alleged Bangladeshi national, from Thane, claiming him to be the real attacker. The next morning on Jan 19, Kanojia was released but he requested them to take him back to Mumbai as he feared that they might follow his trail and question him in front of his family members and relatives. But his plea was turned down. “When I spoke to my mother (in Mumbai) after being released, she seemed very worried as my photo had been shown on all news channels and asked me to return home immediately. The next day, when I called my employer, he asked me to stop reporting for work, saying, ‘You are in legal trouble and I don’t want to get into trouble because of you’. I tried explaining the matter to him but he wasn’t willing to hear me out,\" said Kanojia. In the meantime, he got a call from his grandmother, who told him that the family of his prospective bride had refused to go ahead with the marriage proposal after the entire episode. “After what has happened, I am not sure if I will be able to get married in future,\" he said. He rued that things were going smooth for his family after a long time, but his detention has changed everything. “My brother died some time back after prolonged medical treatment, for which we had to sell whatever we had, including our house in Virar. My father’s garage in Colaba was also shut down after somebody cheated him of ₹9 lakh and fled the country,\" said Kanojia, who is an accused in a drug-related case and a theft case. “I hope the courts will eventually clear me of all the charges,\" he said.

(Image Credit/AFP) The Supreme Court has said expressing disapproval for marriage does not amount to abetment of suicide under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma made the observation while quashing a chargesheet against a woman who was accused of abetting the suicide of another woman who was allegedly in love with her son. related stories The allegations were based on disputes between the deceased and the appellant’s son, who had refused to marry her. The appellant was accused of opposing the marriage and making disparaging remarks against the deceased. The court said even if all evidence on record, including the chargesheet and witness statements, are taken to be correct, there is not an iota of evidence against the appellant. “We find that the acts of the appellant are too remote and indirect to constitute the offence under section 306, IPC. There is no allegation against the appellant of a nature that the deceased was left with no alternative but to commit the unfortunate act of suicide,\" the bench said. The court said it is discerned from the record that the appellant, along with her family, did not attempt to put any pressure on the deceased to end the relationship between her and the appellant’s son. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “In fact, it was the deceased’s family that was unhappy with the relationship. Even if the appellant expressed her disapproval towards the marriage of Babu Das and the deceased, it does not rise to the level of direct or indirect instigation of abetting suicide. “Further, a remark such as asking the deceased to not be alive if she cannot live without marrying her lover will also not gain the status of abetment. There needs to be a positive act that creates an environment where the deceased is pushed to the edge in order to sustain the charge of section 306, IPC,\" the bench said.

(Image/Screenshot) In an exclusive interview with Network18 Group Editor-in-Chief Rahul Joshi at the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj on Saturday, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath offered a comprehensive view of the massive spiritual gathering, political landscape, and his vision for India. Sitting in front of the holy confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers, Yogi Adityanath delved into multiple critical aspects of governance, spirituality, and cultural significance. Asserting that the Maha Kumbh 2025 stands as a testament to India’s spiritual heritage, the UP chief minister highlighted the event’s unprecedented scale. He anticipated that 40-45 crore devotees would participate in the 45-day congregation, transforming the gathering into a powerful symbol of national unity and cultural pride. related stories Beyond the religious spectacle, Yogi Adityanath revealed his broader political philosophy, deeply rooted in what he described as Sanatan Dharma’s principles of inclusivity and integrity. He discussed crucial topics ranging from economic development and welfare schemes to challenges like illegal immigration and the implementation of a uniform civil code. In conversation with Network18, the CM also provided insights into his personal journey —from a mathematics student to a sanyasi and now a prominent political leader — reflecting his belief in service to the nation and commitment to cultural preservation. Edited excerpts: RAHUL JOSHI: Yogi ji, thank you very much for giving this exclusive interview to News18. We are in the Maha Kumbh area today. We are looking at the gathering. The event is grand, unparalleled and spectacular. I would like to know a little about it from you. What went into organising such a big event and what is your message to the world? YOGI ADITYANATH: Rahul ji, firstly, I heartily welcome News18 and your team to the Maha Kumbh area. Whatever you are seeing in Prayagraj and Maha Kumbh Nagar is the concrete form of the vision of the respected Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India’s heritage should get its due respect. It is an example of how it is the responsibility of the government to respect the faith. The divine and grand Kumbh is a testament to this belief. Today’s generation is getting to know about the heritage of thousands of years and the older generation is taking pride in passing on India’s cultural heritage to its next generation so that they can protect it and take it forward in the same grand way. The images from the Maha Kumbh that you witness are the divine and grand form of the Sanatan Dharma. This is what Sanatana is known for. It is India’s tradition to organise such grand Kumbhs to uphold our cultural and spiritual legacy. Such events were started with this aim. This is the holy land of Prayagraj. Crores of devotees take a dip in the Triveni of Maa Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in the presence of saints and get their share of punya (goodness). RAHUL JOSHI: I have been to the Kumbh earlier as well. In 2019, you organised a grand Ardh Kumbh, and I came there too. But the kind of crowd I am seeing this time is usually what we witness on the Mauni Amavasya Snaan. But now there is such a crowd every day. YOGI ADITYANATH: This gathering is a message of the unity of India. You are right. Usually, we would see huge crowds on Mauni Amavasya, but we are seeing similar numbers every day. In 2019, 4 crore devotees bathed in the Sangam on the day of Mauni Amavasya. This time, 4 crore devotees bathed in the Sangam on the day of Makar Sankranti itself. In the past 10 days, more than 10 crore devotees have taken a dip in the Sangam. Today, more than 2 crore devotees are in the Maha Kumbh area for the holy dip. This will go on till February 3. On Mauni Amavasya, we expect the crowds to multiply three to five times compared to 2019. RAHUL JOSHI: Three to five times! What is the total footfall you expect? YOGI ADITYANATH: In my estimate, the 45-day congregation at Maha Kumbh will see a footfall that will be equivalent to the third-largest population in the world…after India and China…in this temporary set-up. We expect 40-45 crore devotees will give the message of national unity through the holy dip at the Sangam. RAHUL JOSHI: Congratulations on this great gat...",

Former judge Muzaffar Iqbal Khan, who won the Assembly election from the Thanamandi constituency as an independent candidate after being denied a ticket by his party the National Conference (NC) following an agreement with its coalition partner Congress, urged for immediate restoration of statehood to end the ‘dual power’ system in the Union Territory. related stories Khan, along with NC leader and MLA Budhal Javaid Iqbal Choudhary and Congress MLA from Rajouri Iftkhar Ahmad, threatened to resign to protest “mishandling of the situation\" in the Badhaal village, where 17 persons belonging to three families died due to mysterious illness between December 7 and January 19. “The press conference was held to express our disappointment and displeasure about this dual system, which is working here in Jammu and Kashmir and has to be stopped somewhere. It is telling upon not only the health, but also on the psyche of the people who voted en masse, elected their representative and are now getting disappointed,\" Khan told PTI in Rajouri. Asserting that it is not in the national interest to run the dual power system in Jammu and Kashmir, he said the Omar Abdullah government must be given full powers, otherwise there will be no end to such types of problems. “We want to send a message to the Union government, which has promised restoration of statehood to J-K in and outside Parliament.

In her address to the nation ahead of the 76th Republic Day, she emphasised the government’s ongoing efforts to “eliminate remnants of a colonial mindset that have lingered in the country for decades\" and cited the replacement of the British-era criminal laws with three new modern laws. related stories “We have been witnessing concerted efforts to change that mindset… Reforms of such magnitude require an audacity of vision,\" she said. Highlighting the significance of the proposed bill aimed at synchronising election schedules across the country, Murmu noted, “The ‘One Nation One Election’ plan can offer numerous benefits, including enhanced governance and reduced financial strain.\" In discussing legal reforms, she pointed out the need to replace the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Indian Evidence Act with new laws reflective of Indian traditions. She mentioned the introduction of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, which prioritise the delivery of justice over mere punishment and place a strong emphasis on addressing crimes against women and children. Reflecting on the significance of the Constitution, the President highlighted the progress achieved over the past 75 years. “At the time of Independence, many parts of the country faced extreme poverty and hunger. However, we maintained a belief in ourselves and created conditions for growth,\" she said. Noting the contributions of farmers and labourers, she said India’s economy now plays a pivotal role in global economic trends, asserting that this transformation is rooted in the framework established by the Constitution. The President also pointed to the persistently high economic growth rate in recent years, which has generated job opportunities, increased income for farmers and labourers, and lifted many out of poverty. She underscored the importance of inclusive growth and the government’s commitment to welfare, making basic necessities such as housing and access to clean drinking water entitlements for citizens. Efforts to support marginalised communities, particularly those belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC), were also highlighted. Murmu mentioned various initiatives, including pre-matric and post-matric scholarships, national fellowships, and dedicated schemes aimed at the socio-economic development of these communities, such as the Pradhan Mantri Anusuchit Jaati Abhyuday Yojana and the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan. The President’s address underscored the government’s commitment to fostering inclusive growth and redefining governance standards in the country, creating a vision for a more equitable and prosperous future for all citizens. She emphasised that this occasion is a collective celebration of joy and pride for all citizens and remarked that while 75 years may seem like a brief moment in the life of a nation, it has been a significant period for India, marked by the revival of its long-dormant spirit and its journey to reclaim its rightful status among the world’s civilisations. Reflecting on India’s historical journey, she urged citizens to remember the brave souls who sacrificed their lives for the nation’s freedom, highlighting the 150th birth anniversary of Bhagwan Birsa Munda, whose contributions to the freedom movement are now receiving due recognition. The President praised the early 20th-century freedom fighters for uniting the nation in a well-organised independence movement and credited iconic figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, and Babasaheb Ambedkar for helping India rediscover its democratic values. “Justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity are not just modern concepts; they have always been integral to our civilisational heritage,\" she asserted, noting that skeptics of the Constitution’s future were proven wrong.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s “ batoge toh katoge \" (If you divide, you will be destroyed) slogan during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections last year had raised some eyebrows. Months later, in an exclusive interview to Network18 Group Editor-in-Chief Rahul Joshi at the Maha Kumbh Mela, the CM explained the meaning of the slogan and how he coined it. The slogan, a call apparently to Hindus to stay united, had sparked a controversy, with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav claiming that the BJP had distanced itself from the slogan. Ajit Pawar — an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Maharashtra — openly disagreed with the chief minister, and said that development cannot happen by creating such differences among each other. related stories Speaking to Network18 on the controversy, Yogi Adityanath recalled his trip to Agra where he unveiled the statue of Durgadas Rathore, the Rathore Rajput general of the kingdom of Marwar. “During Haryana elections, I got the opportunity to go to Mathura. I stayed there for a night, and next day went to Agra to unveil the statue of Durgadas Rathore. In the medieval period, Durgadas Rathore was a very valiant general of the Jodhpur king,\" CM Yogi said. The Story Behind CM Yogi’s ‘Batoge Toh Katoge’ Slogan “According to the tale, when Aurangzeb could not defeat Maharaja Jaswant Singh, the king of Jodhpur, he made a pact with him. Aurangzeb asked them to attack the Afghanis and assured support from behind. When Jaswant Singh ji went to attack the Afghans, Aurangzeb — instead of helping the king as promised — attacked the Raja by deceit. And Raja Jaswant Singh was martyred in that war,\" Yogi Adityanath narrated. “His son Ajit Singh was with him. The queen was also with him. When General Durgadas Rathore saw that after killing the Raja, Aurangzeb’s army was planning to kill the prince, he took Ajit and the queen, and kept them in an ashram. When Prince Ajit Singh grew up, Durgadas put in all the efforts to make Ajit the king of Jodhpur. Till the age of 91, Durgadas Rathore lived in Jodhpur. After that he took sanyaas and went to Ujjain, where he breathed his last,\" the chief minister said. Yogi Adityanath further said, “All those who associate with the story, and who belong to the ‘Rathore-Teli’ caste wanted to install a statue of Durgadas in Agra, but some communities were opposing it. We called both the communities and talked to them. In the end, a compromise was reached. Then when the statue was installed, I said: If you’ll be divided, you will be destroyed. If you remain united, you will be worthier.\" New Slogan: ‘Ek Rahoge Toh Safe Rahoge’ CM Yogi said, “I am thankful that the honourable Prime Minister took this message forward, and gave the slogan of ‘ Ek Rahoge, Safe Rahoge ‘ to connect the entire country. I believe that the message of Maha Kumbh is also that the country will remain united only through unity. If the country remains united, the country will remain safe.\" “Sanatan Dharma will remain safe. Every caste, every opinion, every sect, every creed will also remain safe.

Directed by Noah Hawley, the show promises to reimagine the longest-running sci-fi horror, this time taking viewers to the Earth in 2120. The series is said to be a prequel to Ridley Scott’s 1979 Alien, the first film in the franchise. The 30-second teaser is intense, giving a glimpse of what went down inside a crash-landing spaceship from the view of a Xenomorph. As the teaser unfolded, it showed the alien trying to escape the containment aboard a spacecraft bound for Eart. As the creature prowls through the ship’s dark corridors amid flickering red lights, an automated voice can be heard in the background that repeats, “Containment breach.\" related stories Navigating past the wreckage, exposed wires, and other extraterrestrial creatures, the Xenomorph eventually slams into a window, setting the stage for the horror to descend on the Earth.

That is truly chilling to think of it moving here among us, and so I can’t tell you under what circumstances you’ll see that, but you’ll see it — and you’re going to lock your door that night.\" While Alien: Earth is believed to have a standalone story with a new cast, it is unlikely to connect to the franchise’s most recent release Alien: Romulus.

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Beatles legend Paul McCartney has voiced his concerns about the AI takeover in the world of music, urging the British government to protect the creative industries in the future. McCartney’s views come at a time when there has been a heated debate about the potential threat that artificial intelligence poses to the music industry by not only replacing musicians and composers but also increasing the threat of deepfakes and voice cloning. The 82-year-old in a recent interview warned that the proposed changes to copyright laws could “rip off\" artists. “You get young guys, girls, coming up, and they write a beautiful song, and they don’t own it, and they don’t have anything to do with it. And anyone who wants can just rip it off. The truth is, the money’s going somewhere… Somebody’s getting paid, so why shouldn’t it be the guy who sat down and wrote ‘Yesterday’?\" he told BBC. related stories Further in the discussion, McCartney urged the government to protect the people, adding, “We’re the people, you’re the government. You’re supposed to protect us. That’s your job. So you know, if you’re putting through a bill, make sure you protect the creative thinkers, the creative artists, or you’re not going to have them.\" It is worth mentioning that the UK Labour Party government has time and again expressed its ambition to make Britain a global leader in the field of artificial intelligence. In December 2024, the government launched a consultation to explore how copyright can enable creators’ and right holders’ control over and seek remuneration to use their works for AI training. With the government’s futuristic plans involving AI, the debate around its impact continues to grow. In April, many leading musicians and artists, including Billie Eilish and Nikki Minaj, wrote an open letter to tech companies, digital service providers, and AI developers, criticising their responsible use of AI practices. tags : hollywood Paul McCartney Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 18:38 IST News movies 'Protect Creative Artists': Paul McCartney Sounds Alarm On AI's Impact On Music Industry Read More",

Triptii Dimri became a sensation after starring in Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal. Her fame grew manifolds after the film’s release and she soon starred in films like Bad Newz, Vicky Aur Vidya Ka Voh Wala Video and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3. However, Parambrata Chatterjee, her Bulbbul costar, believes that she still has to prove herself and has miles to go. During an event organised by SCREEN, Parambrata ranked Vidya Balan as the most talented actress and took Triptii’s name last.

Bhabhi 2!\" related stories The actor explained, “She is lovely, a very nice girl, and I really get along with her. But she still has miles to go.

When asked whether she would try to move away from her “overtly sexualised\" image, Triptii dismissed the notion. “I am going with the flow. The aim is to play different characters because I don’t want to go to a set and feel bored. I want to feel challenged and wonder, ‘How will this happen?’—and then make it happen,\" she explained.

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Sunil Kumar Gupta, the former superintendent of Delhi’s Tihar Jail, is back in the spotlight with the release of the Netflix series Black Warrant . The show, inspired by Gupta’s real-life experiences and the book Black Warrant: Confessions of a Tihar Jailer, co-authored with journalist Sunetra Chowdhary, dives deep into the challenges and secrets of India’s most infamous prison. Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane and starring Zahan Kapoor as Gupta, the series sheds light on issues like corruption, gang violence, and security lapses in Indian prisons. Gupta’s life story, as portrayed in the series, has sparked conversations about prison reforms and justice. related stories In 1981, Sunil Kumar Gupta left a secure job with Indian Railways to pursue his dream of joining the police force. Despite his modest background and lack of the typical physical build for prison officers, he secured the role of assistant superintendent. Upon joining Tihar, he faced an unexpected challenge—there were no vacancies for his position. This initial setback almost ended his career before it began, but Gupta persevered. Gupta’s tenure at Tihar exposed him to the harsh realities of prison life, from death sentence executions to the struggles of inmates deprived of their basic legal rights. One particularly emotional moment was his interaction with Afzal Guru, convicted for the 2001 Parliament attack. On the day of Guru’s execution, the terrorist noted the compassion in Gupta’s eyes, leaving a lasting impact on the jailer. Gupta introduced significant reforms during his time at Tihar. He established the prison’s first legal aid cell, offering free legal assistance to disadvantaged inmates. He also initiated special court sessions within the jail to expedite minor cases, helping many prisoners avoid prolonged incarceration due to lack of resources. In 1988, Gupta played a key role in drafting the Delhi Prison Act and Manual, which governed prison operations for nearly 30 years. Since retiring in 2016, Sunil Kumar Gupta has continued his advocacy for the underprivileged. He now practices law at the Delhi High Court and Supreme Court, championing the rights of those in need. His legacy of compassion and reform is a testament to his dedication to justice.

Published By : Yatamanyu Narain Trending Desk Last Updated: January 27, 2025, 16:28 IST On Thursday (January 23), Ye posted a screenshot on Instagram, revealing the new valuation. reset Follow us on Google News Hollywood flooded the comments section to congratulate him.  (Photo Credits: X) Kanye West, also known as Ye, is once again making waves with his claim of being back in the billionaire’s club. The polarising figure, who has faced his fair share of controversies, asserts that his net worth now exceeds an eye-popping $2.77 billion. On Thursday (January 23), Ye posted a screenshot on Instagram, revealing the new valuation, which reportedly comes from the business valuation company Eton Venture Services. The document lists his fortune as being made up of his music catalogue and the full ownership of his Yeezy brand, two major assets that have significantly contributed to his wealth. “In 2025, Ye’s net worth stands at $2.77 billion USD as confirmed by Eton Venture Services,\" the post read, credited to EVS. “The valuation is based on his music portfolio and his sole ownership of the Yeezy mark.\" While this bold claim has yet to be fully confirmed by an independent source, Ye’s confidence seems unshaken, reports Billboard. related stories As expected, Ye was energised by the reported figure and made sure to celebrate in true Ye fashion. He took to quoting his iconic anthem, “Can’t Tell Me Nothing,\" from his 2007 Graduation album, a track known for its triumphant tone and brash confidence. “LAA LA LA LA,\" Ye wrote, echoing the track’s unmistakable intro. The post quickly gained traction, with fans, fellow musicians, and even Bay Area rap legend E-40 flooding the comments to congratulate him. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ye (@ye) Despite the buzz surrounding Ye’s latest valuation claims, not everyone is on the same page. As of Friday (January 24), Forbes reportedly values him at just $400 million—significantly lower than the $2.77 billion he asserts. This stark contrast is particularly striking given that Forbes had recognised Ye as a billionaire in 2022. However, a series of controversies that year, including antisemitic remarks, triggered a major backlash. Brands like Adidas, Balenciaga, and Gap cut ties with him, leading to a dramatic drop in his estimated net worth, according to Forbes. When Forbes had originally listed him as a billionaire in 2022, Ye himself argued that the figures were way off, insisting that his true worth was closer to $7 billion. Following his fallout with Adidas and other brands later that year, Forbes revised their estimate and slashed his net worth to just $400 million, a far cry from the $7 billion he had previously claimed. This new figure from Eton Venture Services, however, if true, could drastically shift the narrative once again.

Urvashi Rautela often finds herself at the centre of controversy as clips from her interviews go viral on social media platforms. The actress isn’t afraid to speak her mind and is known for her candour. However, she also lands up in trouble when her comments don’t sit right with netizens. She recently reacted to being called ‘Beauty With No Brains’. Speaking to Instant Bollywood about the tag, she said, “Isme kya hai na… humare jo desh ke Pradhan Mantri bhi hain, Shri Narendra Modi ji, mere sabse zyada favourite superstars Shah Rukh Khan aur Salman Khan – toh log jo hain voh toh unko bhi nahi bakshte. Toh aap hi bataiye ki phir isme kya kiya jaaye?\" related stories View this post on Instagram A post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood) Urvashi Rautela hit the headlines last week after she faced flak for her comments about Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan’s attack. While condemning the attack, the actress shifted the conversation to discussing expensive gifts that her parents had given her after the success of her film ‘Daaku Maharaaj’. She flaunted her diamond-studded Rolex and other jewellery, which many found tone-deaf and insensitive. She then apologized on Instagram, but later deleted the post. Now, in a recent interview, Urvashi explained that she was caught off guard and was unaware of the full details of the attack on Saif Ali Khan. While speaking with Filmfare, Urvashi Rautela said that the question about Saif Ali Khan caught her off guard because the attack happened at 4 am, and she had an interview the next morning while she was still processing the news. She said that she kept bringing up her film Daaku Maharaaj as the interviews were lined up to celebrate the success of her film. She also admitted that the excitement about her parents’ gifts caused her to go off-topic and that it was a moment of misplaced enthusiasm rather than an attempt to ‘show off’. tags : bollywood Narendra Modi Shah Rukh Khan Urvashi Rautela Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 16:12 IST News movies Urvashi Rautela Reacts To 'Beauty With No Brain' Tag, Says People Don't Spare Narendra Modi, SRK Either Read More",

Curated By : Yatamanyu Narain News18.com Last Updated: January 27, 2025, 16:11 IST Director-actor duo Srijit Mukherji and Parambrata Chatterjee addressed the state of Bengali cinema in Kolkata, responding to Anurag Kashyap’s critique labeling it as “ghatia.” reset Follow us on Google News Parambrata Chatterjee responds to Anurag Kashyap’s remark on Bengali cinema being “ghatia,” highlighting the decline of mainstream films. Director-actor duo Srijit Mukherji and Parambrata Chatterjee recently attended the inaugural edition of SCREEN LIVE in Kolkata, where an engaging discussion unfolded around the state of Bengali cinema. The conversation touched on Hindi filmmaker Anurag Kashyap’s controversial remark that labeled Bengali cinema as “ghatia\" (poor) compared to other regional industries. Parambrata responded thoughtfully, shedding light on the decline of mainstream Bengali cinema and its critical connection to the survival of alternative films. Highlighting the issue, Parambrata explained, “Mainstream commercial Bengali cinema has lost its focus. Without a thriving mainstream industry, it’s challenging to sustain alternative cinema because the latter depends on surplus generated by the former. In 2011, while filmmakers like Srijit da and Kaushik Ganguly spearheaded a revival with middle-road films, the industry distanced itself from making big, massy entertainers.\" He pointed to a growing disconnect between filmmakers and audiences, exacerbated by poorly executed South Indian remakes that alienated Bengali viewers. “Audiences rejected these sub-par remakes because they could already watch the originals dubbed in Hindi on national channels. This failure shrank the audience for Bengali cinema, leaving large sections of West Bengal feeling neglected,\" he added, stressing the need to produce quality mass entertainers to reinvigorate the industry. related stories Srijit Mukherji echoed this sentiment, urging filmmakers to focus on originality and regional authenticity. He cited the success of South Indian films like Kantara and Pushpa 2 as examples of cinema rooted in local culture that resonated universally. “Bengali filmmakers need to move beyond the lazy habit of remaking South Indian hits. We need to create something uniquely ours, a Kantara or Pushpa 2 equivalent for Bengal,\" he asserted. The duo’s latest project, Shotyi Bole Shotyi Kichhu Nei, is currently playing in theatres. An official adaptation of the 1989 Hindi film Ek Ruka Hua Faisla, which itself reimagined the classic American courtroom drama 12 Angry Men, the film boasts a stellar ensemble cast, including Kaushik Ganguly, Kaushik Sen, Ritwick Chakraborty, and others. Through both their creative ventures and their critique of the industry, Mukherji and Chatterjee continue to advocate for a stronger and more diverse Bengali cinema. tags : Anurag Kashyap bollywood Parambrata Chatterjee Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 16:11 IST News movies Parambrata Chatterjee Reacts To Anurag Kashyap’s Harsh Words On Bengali Cinema: ‘We Need To Make...'

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Timothee Chalamet took to the Saturday Night Live stage on January 25 with a playful energy that had the audience laughing from the get-go. For his third time hosting the iconic show, the 29-year-old actor didn’t just come to deliver comedy, he also brought his musical talents as the night’s guest performer. And true to his style, he kicked off his monologue with a healthy dose of self-deprecating humour and a bit of cheeky commentary on his recent career journey. “Hosting SNL again is great, but this time, I’ve got something new, a little moustache and a goatee!\" Chalamet said with a smile, making light of his appearance and a joke he’d made earlier at the Golden Globes. “37 hairs right here,\" he said, pointing to his goatee as the camera zoomed in for effect, drawing a laugh from the crowd. related stories The actor, fresh off his portrayal of Willy Wonka in Wonka, also took a moment to reflect on his latest role as the legendary Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. “Playing Bob Dylan right after Willy Wonka? Yeah, that was a little strange,\" he admitted. “But you know what? I found out they have a lot in common. They’re both eccentric, innovative and let’s not forget, both enslaved hundreds of Oompa-Loompas,\" he added. Chalamet, never one to shy away from poking fun at himself, segued into a hilarious segment about his ongoing streak of losses at major award shows. After all, A Complete Unknown has earned eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, yet the actor continues to face defeat with grace and wit. “It’s such an honour to go to these award shows,\" Chalamet began his tone half-serious and half-joking. “But let’s be real, I keep losing. And every time it happens, it gets a little harder to act like it doesn’t sting.\" With that, he rolled a montage of his defeated, and often humorous, reactions to his loss at previous ceremonies. “Oh look, another lonely night with my Dune popcorn bucket,\" he laughed as one particularly painful loss was displayed. Not one to dwell on disappointment, Chalamet quickly turned things around by pretending to practice an acceptance speech, until the scene was hilariously interrupted by SNL cast member Kenan Thompson, who grabbed the mock trophy and delivered a comedic take of his own. Before leaving the stage, Chalamet gave a sneak peek into his musical segment, teasing his performances of Bob Dylan songs. “You might not know the songs I’m going to perform, but trust me, they’re my personal favourites,\" he shared. “And I’m just so thankful that SNL is still doing weird stuff like this 50 years in. Honestly, they’re either really kind to let me do this… or this is a prank, and I’ll find out later. I can’t tell,\" he added. Following an introduction by former SNL star Adam Sandler, Chalamet launched into a high-energy rendition of Dylan’s Outlaw Blues. The performance effortlessly transitioned into a more intimate, spoken-word version of Three Angels, with surprise guest James Blake joining him on keyboards and vocals. Chalamet rounded out his musical set with a heartfelt cover of Tomorrow Is a Long Time, proving that he’s not just a charming host, but a talented musician with a deep connection to the music he’s performing, reports Billboard. tags : entertainment hollywood Timothee Chalamet Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 14:28 IST News movies Watch: Timothee Chalamet Talks Playing Bob Dylan And His ‘Little Stache’ On SNL Read More",

Curated By : Kashvi Raj Singh News18.com Last Updated: January 27, 2025, 14:06 IST Twinkle Khanna said Akshay Kumar is not a toddler who will listen to everything she says. reset Follow us on Google News Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna. Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna tied the knot in 2001 and have been married for nearly 24 years now. The couple has two children, a son named Aarav and a daughter named Nitara. However, the two have very different ideologies and barely have commonalities. They have often addressed how they have differing political views and in her latest column for the Times of India, Twinkle mentioned how she is often blamed for them having contrasting ideologies. Twinkle Khanna wrote, “Sitting  for an interview, I am asked, ‘You are a star wife; tell us what it’s like?’ While my first instinct is to bite the reporter’s index finger, I reply, ‘I am not sure that an entity like ‘star wife’ exists, unless, in the way that Manglik women marry trees, because of some Rahu Ketu ka dosh, you end up marrying Sirius or worse, Halley’s Comet.’\" related stories She added, “After 20 years of answering this annoying question, I have an oyster-like attitude to irritants and the ability to craft black pearls of wisdom in response. I’m also often asked about — and blamed for — the difference in our political views. It’s almost like people believe he isn’t my husband but a toddler who will listen to me when I say, ‘Beta ji, please walk on the left side of the road, and I will give you a Frooti.’\" In a previous interview with Galatta India, Akshay Kumar also spoke about the differences between him and Twinkle. Akshay said, “Me and my wife are very different. We are poles apart. She thinks left, I think right. The only thing which is common in us is that we both like to sleep early and wake up early. Another thing which we like is playing Rummy or Ludo. Nothing else is common in us. But, it’s not just about that. Respect is the most important thing. It is important to give each other space. There are 36 traits in people, not necessarily they all have to be common in a couple. But if you have that one trait of respecting each other, I think it’s equivalent to having all the traits you need in a relationship.\" Meanwhile, on the work front, Akshay Kumar is currently seen in Sky Force. The film marks Veer Pahariya’s debut and also stars Sara Ali Khan. tags : Akshay Kumar bollywood Twinkle Khanna Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 14:06 IST News movies Twinkle Khanna Says She's 'Blamed' For Akshay Kumar's Political Views: 'People Believe He Isn't My Husband...'

Sky Force Box Office Collection Report Day 3: After a modest start, Akshay Kumar and debutant Veer Pahariya’s Sky Force took off with impressive momentum over its opening weekend. The aerial action film showed remarkable growth on Saturday and sustained it on Sunday, closing its first weekend on a high note. If it can clear the crucial Monday test, the film could be headed for a solid lifetime run. Sky Force earned ₹12.25 crore on its opening day, slightly underwhelming for a project of its scale. However, the film bounced back with an 80% surge on Saturday, collecting ₹22 crore. On Sunday, it added another ₹27.50 crore, bringing its domestic nett total to ₹61.75 crore. According to Sacnilk, the producers suggest the opening weekend collection might touch ₹70 crore. related stories The film has also performed decently overseas, earning $600K (₹5 crore) in its first two days, although the bulk of its earnings is expected to come from the Indian market, a hallmark of Akshay Kumar’s films. Positive word-of-mouth and strong reviews have fueled Sky Force’s growth. The crucial Monday collections will determine whether the film can maintain its momentum and secure a robust first-week haul. Directed by Abhishek Anil Kapur and Sandeep Kewlani, Sky Force draws inspiration from the Indo-Pakistani air war of 1965, focusing on the Sargodha airbase attack in Pakistan. The film stars Akshay Kumar, Veer Pahariya, Sara Ali Khan, and Sharad Kelkar, with a special cameo by Nimrat Kaur. News18 Showsha review of the film reads, “At 2 hours 5 minutes, Sky Force makes for a crisp and taut screenplay that rarely drops pace. Kudos to the director duo, who seamlessly blend in their individual instincts and style, never once making you wonder that there are two captains sailing the ship! The film is bereft of melodramatic dialogues about desh bhakti or contrived sequences aimed to evoke sappy sentimentality. The makers manage to strike a fine balance between realism and cinematic flamboyance and they deserve brownie points for the same.\" It further stated, “The aerial saga is a true Republic Day treat and it deserves a watch for its execution and treatment. It packs a punch without trying too hard and sets a precedent for a modern-day patriotic film where friendship and loyalty take a precedence over politics and ultra-nationalism.\" tags : Akshay Kumar bollywood veer pahariya Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 14:05 IST News movies Sky Force Box Office Collection Day 3: Akshay Kumar And Veer Pahariya’s Film Soars With Rs 61 Crore Opening Weekend Read More",

Ahead of Ziro On Tour, he reflects on his journey, the struggles behind his breakout album, and his commitment to authenticity. reset Follow us on Google News From nearly quitting music to creating the phenomenon Bombay Dreams with over 12.2 million streams, Taba Chake redefined India’s indie scene. Hailing from the picturesque village of Rono in Arunachal Pradesh, Taba Chake is not your average singer-songwriter. Armed with a guitar, a deep connection to nature, and a knack for weaving multilingual magic, he’s the Nyishi fingerstyle guitarist who’s taking India’s indie scene by storm. Fluent in Nyishi, Hindi, English, Nepali, and Assamese, Taba crafts songs that transcend boundaries—both linguistic and emotional—making him one of the most authentic voices in Indian music today. Starting his musical journey at six and penning his first songs by eleven, Taba’s story is as enchanting as his melodies. His debut EP, Bond with Nature (2016), gave listeners a glimpse into his world—a unique blend of tribal folklore and contemporary sounds. But it was his 2019 album, Bombay Dreams, that truly showcased his genius. With tracks like Meri Dastaan and This is the Day—both years in the making—Taba’s dedication to storytelling and soulful melodies was unmistakable. related stories Taba’s music isn’t just about sounds; it’s a love letter to his roots. Drawing inspiration from the lush landscapes of Arunachal Pradesh, birdsong, and tribal folklore, his percussive guitar playing and heartfelt vocals transport listeners to another world. Whether at the iconic Ziro Festival of Music or onstage at Ragasthan, Taba has made waves across India, leaving audiences captivated. In 2024, Taba made a surprising leap into Bollywood, composing music for Shoojit Sircar’s I Want To Talk, starring Abhishek Bachchan. While he still calls indie music his home, this milestone showed his ability to blend his unique style into mainstream cinema, further broadening his artistic horizons. Now, Taba Chake is ready to charm Hyderabad at the Ziro On Tour festival, a first-of-its-kind initiative by Signature Packaged Drinking Water and Ziro Festival of Music. Taking the magic of India’s most eco-friendly music festival beyond Arunachal Pradesh, Ziro On Tour is set to dazzle audiences at the historic Taramati Baradari on February 1st and 2nd, 2025. With its blend of music, sustainability, and cultural immersion, this event promises to raise a toast to community spirit and mindful living. In an exclusive conversation with News18 Showsha, Taba opened up about his musical journey, the years it took to craft Bombay Dreams, and how he almost gave up on music—only to come back stronger. From visualizing his songs to preparing for his performance at Ziro On Tour, Taba Chake’s story is proof that music, when rooted in authenticity, has the power to bridge worlds and touch hearts. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Taba Chake (@taba.chake) Here are the excerpts: Let’s start with the Ziro Festival of Music. What are your thoughts on the idea of taking it beyond Arunachal Pradesh to a city like Hyderabad? Do you think it could connect with a whole new audience? Absolutely, I have no doubt about it. Music transcends boundaries—it’s something that resonates with everyone, no matter the place or language. A city like Hyderabad has such a vibrant and diverse crowd, so bringing the Ziro Festival there would definitely open it up to a whole new audience. I believe this could be a massive hit. If the organizers decide to expand and make the Ziro Tour a regular thing, I’m sure it would continue to grow in popularity year after year. It’s all about sharing that incredible energy and spirit of the festival with more people, and I think Hyderabad is the perfect place to start. Signature Packaged Drinking Water is supporting sustainability at Ziro On Tour. As an artist and storyteller, how do you feel about sustainability being woven into the festival’s narrative? I think it’s an incredible initiative. As an artist, sustainability resonates deeply with me because it aligns with the stories I want to tell and the legacy I hope to leave behind. I often tell my team that when we’re planning something—whether it’s a tour or a project—we strive to think beyond the usual. We want something unique, something meaningful, and most importantly, something green. It’s important for us to incorporate recycled and sustainable elements, not just for the sake of doing it but because it reflects where I come from and the values embedded in my music. What Ziro Festival is doing—tying sustainability into its core narrative—is truly inspiring. I know it’s ...",

I was very small at that time, so I would come here. Today, all those memories have come rushing back. There have been a lot of changes in Vadodara.

A lot of changes have taken place in this area since then.\" “Gujarat has been closely associated with filmmaking for a long time.

(Photo: Instagram) Swwapnil Joshi, who was last seen in Nitin Kamble’s Jilabi believes that the fact that there’s a dearth of good writers, is a universal issue. The actor-producer feels that films are a “writer-director medium\" and that they are not an actor’s medium. “Good writing and good direction is what makes a film good. We [actors] bring people to the theatre. I am the device to get you to the theatre. Then after that, it is the story that appeals to you. This is why I always say that for any film, the weekend collection is my responsibility, but from Monday onwards, the film will speak for itself,\" he said in an exclusive interview with News18 Showsha. related stories The Mumbai-Pune-Mumbai actor stated that he feels “there are less writers overall\". Adding to his point, he said, “Thankfully, we are going back to our roots now. We have stopped looking outside, and we have started looking within ourselves. I always say that I have done many rom-coms, and a lot of them have worked well, too. Ultimately, I have to say a Marathi story. People always ask me, ‘When will there be a film like Baahubali in Marathi?’ I always tell them that there will not be a film like Baahubali made in Marathi. Because that is not my story. I have to say stories from the Konkan region. I want to do stories on the country. I have to tell the stories of my people, my culture and traditions. Only if I present what is mine, will it look unique among the clutter. So, yes, that dearth is there, I agree.\" Having said that, does he plan to expand his wings in 2025 and do something new? “I would like to explore writing. I have always felt that I am not a person who will say that ‘you do not know to write’. I can say that with authority if I know how to write. Otherwise, it is too easy to point a finger at someone and say that the writing is bad or he makes horrible films. It is a very difficult process. I would want to write something. I want to write a slice-of-life story. Because that’s the closest to what I am as a person. Not essentially that it will become a film or not necessary for it to translate into something commercial, but I just want to test those waters,\" he concluded. tags : regional cinema Showsha Exclusives Swwapnil Joshi Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 10:18 IST News movies Swwapnil Joshi Says He Won't Make A Film Like Baahubali In Marathi: 'That Is Not My...' | Exclusive Read More",

Veer Pahariya’s acting debut in Sky Force has become the talk of the town. It’s no secret that he comes from one of the most powerful political families in the country. His maternal grandfather, Sushilkumar Shinde, was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra between 2003 and 2004. Veer’s maternal aunt, Praniti Shinde, is a member of the Lok Sabha. However, the young actor decided to not follow their footsteps and venture into politics. In an exclusive chat with News18 Showsha, Veer reveals the reason behind this decision. Talking about how he wanted to carve a niche for himself, he tells us, “People in my family have achieved so much and I knew that being in this family means being sheltered. Very early on in my life, I knew that I wanted to do something different. I always wanted to have my own identity, for as young as I can remember. When I walked into a room, I didn’t want people to know me for the family I come from. I wanted them to know me for who I am and what I bring to the table.\" related stories Walking down the memory lane, Veer says that hailing from a political family comes with its own disadvantages and yet he managed to lead a regular life as an adolescent. “When I was five or six, I knew that my life was extremely protected. There were a lot of reasons because of which we couldn’t do certain things. But I lived a very simple life. I don’t have too many friends and those that are, are very normal and simple people from all around the country,\" he remarks. According to him, getting enrolled in a boarding school in Haryana opened him up to a new world. And the friends he made there acclimatised him to a new life. “I feel like I’m connected to the cultural fabric and diversity of this country because of my friends, who come from different backgrounds. I, anyway, didn’t grow up in an urban setting like Mumbai or Delhi. The thing is, I’ve always been rebellious because I wanted to act,\" says Veer, who has been an assistant director in Bhediya. He further adds, “At a young age, I knew that I couldn’t live life in a certain setting with my family because one needs to really live life to become an actor. That’s why I put myself out there and did risky things right since childhood. And acting is something that came to me naturally – maybe five percent naturally and for the remaining, I had to really work hard. I don’t take anything for granted.\" And how has his family reacted to his portrayal of late Air Force officer Ajjamada Boppayya Devayya in Sky Force? “I got a very warm appreciation from my parents, nani, nana and close family members. Unfortunately, my dada passed away a month ago, so I couldn’t have him see the film. But he blessed me and I’ve it on WhatsApp and his words will remain very, very special. My family is very proud of me for being a part of Sky Force,\" states Veer. tags : bollywood Showsha Exclusives sushil kumar shinde veer pahariya Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 10:08 IST News movies Veer Pahariya On Not Joining Politics Like 'Nana' Sushilkumar Shinde: ‘Didn’t Want People To…’ | Exclusive Read More",

I don’t know if you can see it in my face (laughs). But I’m very, very happy about it because I was waiting for it. I gave my life and soul to Sky Force. It’s been a journey of more than three years.\" He further adds, “I may have been working on films for many years but there were long periods of waiting too. I waited for a time like this when I wouldn’t have the time to do anything else except for work. I’m very happy with the rejections I had and the tests I had go through because they made me stronger. I think as an artist, it’s okay to be in love with your work but your work also needs to bring in money because there are producers investing in your film. I’m very grateful to everyone for accepting me.\" related stories The reaction from his family has been overwhelming too, including grandfather Sushilkumar Shinde, the former Chief Minister of Maharashtra. “My family is very proud of me for being a part of Sky Force,\" states Veer.

They’ve often been spotted out and about attending high-profile events. How would Veer describe his equation his Shikhar, a horse rider and a professional polo player? “He’s not in the public eye. He isn’t very accessible. To me, he’s a friend figure. He’s someone I can go to if I need personal or professional advice. We talk about everything and we’re very close. Both he and I are very normal. We’re very simple people. We don’t care about materialistic things. Experiences are more important for us,\" he remarks. Shikhar’s profession may keep him away from the limelight but he often hits headlines for his relationship with Janhvi Kapoor, who has been showering praises on Veer for his debut. Talking about her, he says, “Janhvi and Khushi (Kapoor) are my first actor friends in the industry.\" As for Khushi, his contemporary, who marked her debut a while ago, Veer asserts that he doesn’t look at the new crop of actors as his competition. “I think it’s very good and important for new talents to come in. I don’t look at it as competition. It’s more like a collaboration. If I’m able to learn something from another artist and they’ve their unique style and voice, it will only help me and the industry in getting more viewers. I think, the more, the merrier,\" shares Veer, who was an assistant director on Varun Dhawan’s Bhediya. tags : bollywood Janhvi Kapoor khushi kapoor Shikhar Pahariya Showsha Exclusives veer pahariya Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 27, 2025, 09:38 IST News movies Veer Pahariya Calls Brother Shikhar And Himself ‘Simple’; Adds ‘Janhvi and Khushi Are My…’ | Exclusive Read More",

Boys are like aggressive and loud, ‘Papa this and that.’ But quietly my daughter has full control over me. Without saying anything, she has full control over me.

It’s important to teach them the basics, it’s combination of all that. Let children be. They are born off you, they aren’t yours. They aren’t your property. They are their own individual. You are just the caretaker. You just have to given them what they need.\" Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput got married in 2015. They welcomed their daiughter Misha in 2016.

Bobby, in these films, showcased his range as an actor, solidifying his position in the entertainment industry. Despite the talent, his career faced a decline as the 2000s progressed.

Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol pose with their kids on Diwali. Between 2013 to 2017, his career hit rock bottom as he had no releases during the period. Although he kept working, Bobby Deol could not regain the stature that he had earned during the 90s. Just when his star appeal seemed to be fading, the actor made a comeback in 2020.

Urvashi Rautela was recently also in the news as she faced backlash for her comments about the attack on actor Saif Ali Khan. While condemning the attack, the actress shifted the conversation to discussing expensive gifts that her parents had given her after the success of her film ‘Daaku Maharaaj’. She flaunted her diamond-studded Rolex and other jewellery. This left netizens disappointed, who then called her insensitive. related stories View this post on Instagram A post shared by URVASHI RAUTELA (@urvashirautela) However, in a recent interview, Urvashi talked about the incident. She claimed that she was caught off guard and was unaware of the full details of the attack on Saif Ali Khan. “I think I should have been way more careful with the way I answered. I have to admit that I should have answered it more carefully. Also, the incident happened at 4 am (Saif’s attack), and very next day my interviews happened at 8 am. So, I was completely kind of clueless. All I remember is that when I was waking up someone told me, he got hurt. I don’t know the intensity of how he got hurt. I wasn’t aware of the intensity of what all has happened with him,\" she said. Urvashi further mentioned that she kept bringing up her film Daaku Maharaaj as the interviews were lined up to celebrate the success of her film. She also admitted that the excitement about her parents’ gifts caused her to go off-topic, and that it was a moment of misplaced enthusiasm rather than an attempt to ‘show-off’. tags : bollywood Urvashi Rautela Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 26, 2025, 18:42 IST News movies Urvashi Rautela Hugs Her Hospitalised Mother, Urges All To Pray For Her | Photo Read More",

The… pic.twitter.com/CNttOIlSze — ANI (@ANI) January 26, 2025 First released on October 16, 1998, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai became a cultural phenomenon that redefined Bollywood romance. Written and directed by Karan Johar in his debut project, the film featured Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, and Rani Mukerji in lead roles, with Salman Khan making a special appearance. The story intertwined themes of love, friendship, and self-discovery, presented in two contrasting narratives. The first half captured the vibrant college life of Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan), his tomboyish best friend Anjali (Kajol), and the charming Tina (Rani Mukerji). Rahul’s belief that “love is friendship\" shaped the dynamics of their relationship, leaving Anjali heartbroken when Rahul fell for Tina. The second half transitioned into a poignant story of loss and reconciliation, as Tina’s letters to her daughter, Anjali Khanna, set the stage for reuniting the elder Anjali and Rahul. The film struck an emotional chord with audiences worldwide, seamlessly blending humor, drama, and sentiment. Its universal themes of unrequited love and second chances resonated deeply, making it a timeless classic. The soundtrack, composed by Jatin-Lalit, became an instant sensation with hits like “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,\" “Tujhe Yaad Na Meri Aayi,\" and “Koi Mil Gaya,\" further elevating its appeal. Kajol’s portrayal of Anjali showcased her versatility, transforming from a carefree tomboy to a mature woman. Shah Rukh Khan’s charisma and Rani Mukerji’s elegance added depth to the narrative, while Salman Khan’s cameo as Aman brought another layer of complexity to the story. The film’s success was reflected in its numerous accolades, including eight Filmfare Awards, such as Best Film, Best Director, and acting honors for its stellar cast. Decades later, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai continues to inspire global audiences, as seen in the Indonesian delegation’s heartfelt tribute. Its evergreen music, memorable dialogues, and iconic characters cement its place as one of Bollywood’s most cherished films, showcasing the universal power of cinema to bridge cultures and create connections. tags : bollywood Kajol Kuch Kuch Hota Hai Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 26, 2025, 18:27 IST News movies Kajol Reacts To Kuch Kuch Hota Hai Tribute By Indonesian Delegation: 'Bollywood’s Power To Unite Shines Again' Read More",

The actress, who recently took sanyaas during the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 with the Kinnar Akhara, has declared that returning to the film industry is unimaginable for her. Reflecting on her transformation, she shared that her focus is now entirely on spirituality, marking a significant departure from her Bollywood days. In a candid conversation with India Today, Mamta stated, “I can’t even imagine doing films again. It is absolutely impossible for me now.\" She described her spiritual journey as deeply fulfilling, likening her honor as a Mahamandaleshwar of the Kinnar Akhara to winning an Olympic medal after 23 years of devotion. related stories The Kinnar Akhara, which represents the divine Ardhnareshwar form of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, resonated with her desire for freedom and spiritual awakening.

(ANI photo) The earlier detention of a Colaba resident in connection with the attack on Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan has resulted in him losing his job and cancellation of his marriage, according to a report in Hindustan Times. The 31-year-old Mumbai resident, identified as Akash Kailash Kanojia, was detained on January 18, two days after a horrifying attack on the actor at his Bandra residence. Kanojia was detained from Durg railway station while he was on his way back to his native place, Nehla, in Chhattisgarh from Mumbai. related stories The Colaba resident told Hindustan Times that he was travelling to Bilaspur via Jnaneswar Express on January 17 to meet his ailing grandmother and prospective bride when he was detained by railway protection force (RPF) officers at the station. This happened after an erroneous alert by Mumbai police to RPF, claiming that Kanojia was the person behind the foiled robbery attempt at actor’s Mumbai residence. Sharing the ordeal, the 31-year-old said that soon after he was nabbed, his photographs were circulated widely on TV channels and media outlets which led him to losing his job as well as suffering a setback in personal life as the bride’s family refused to meet him. “The RPF personnel not only apprehended me, they also issued a press release with my photograph, which was shown widely by television channels and media outlets. As a result, the bride’s family cancelled the meeting with me and my employer terminated my services,\" Hindustan Times quoted Kanojia as saying. Kanojia worked as a driver for a tour company which works with Western Railway in Mumbai. On January 17, he received a call from Mumbai police, which asked him about his whereabouts. When he told the officer that he was at home, the latter disconnected the call, he told Hindustan Times. “The next day, I boarded Jnaneswari Express from Mumbai hoping to visit my ailing grandmother in our native place Nehla in Chhattisgarh. I was supposed to change trains in Bilaspur to go to Nehla and was slated to meet the family of my prospective bride later,\" he told HT. On January 18, when the train reached Durg junction at around 10am, RPF personnel detained him, suspecting him to be Saif’s attacker and took him to Raipur. The Mumbai police team reached there almost 12 hours later and told him that he would be brought back to the city the following day for further probe. He told police that he had nothing to do with the attack but they didn’t listen to him. “I told the police that I had nothing to do with the attack on Saif Ali Khan and offered to make them speak with my relatives. I also told them that they could check footage from CCTVs installed near my house to clarify their doubts. But they did not pay any heed – instead, they took my photos and circulated them in the media, claiming I was the attacker,\" said Kanojia. However, the same day, police arrested Shariful Islam Shehzad, an alleged Bangladeshi national, from Thane, claiming him to be the real attacker. The next morning on Jan 19, Kanojia was released but he requested them to take him back to Mumbai as he feared that they might follow his trail and question him in front of his family members and relatives. But his plea was turned down. “When I spoke to my mother (in Mumbai) after being released, she seemed very worried as my photo had been shown on all news channels and asked me to return home immediately. The next day, when I called my employer, he asked me to stop reporting for work, saying, ‘You are in legal trouble and I don’t want to get into trouble because of you’. I tried explaining the matter to him but he wasn’t willing to hear me out,\" said Kanojia. In the meantime, he got a call from his grandmother, who told him that the family of his prospective bride had refused to go ahead with the marriage proposal after the entire episode. “After what has happened, I am not sure if I will be able to get married in future,\" he said. He rued that things were going smooth for his family after a long time, but his detention has changed everything. “My brother died some time back after prolonged medical treatment, for which we had to sell whatever we had, including our house in Virar. My father’s garage in Colaba was also shut down after somebody cheated him of ₹9 lakh and fled the country,\" said Kanojia, who is an accused in a drug-related case and a theft case. “I hope the courts will eventually clear me of all the charges,\" he said. After all the chaos, Kanojia wants all his photos, identifying him as the attacker, be taken down fr...",

Lively claimed these exchanges were part of a calculated effort to tarnish her reputation. Abel, however, dismissed these allegations, stating that no coordinated campaign was ever executed. “What the cherry-picked messages don’t include, although not shockingly, as it doesn’t fit the narrative, is that it was no ‘smear’ implied, no negative press was ever facilitated, no social combat plan, although we were prepared for it, as it’s our job to be ready for any scenario, but we didn’t have to implement anything, because the internet was doing the work for us,\" Abel wrote. tags : Blake Lively hollywood Justin Baldoni Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 26, 2025, 14:52 IST News movies Justin Baldoni's Mother Defends Son For The First Time Amid Blake Lively Allegations: ‘Truth Will Shine’ Read More",

Bollywood actor Shahid Kapoor, set to grace the screen in his upcoming action thriller Deva, recently shared candid insights about dealing with heartbreak and the lessons it taught him. Reflecting on his past relationships, Shahid admitted to feelings of inadequacy and neediness, acknowledging these as selfish tendencies he has worked to understand and overcome. His honest take on emotional growth is resonating widely with fans. During a podcast with Raj Shamani, Shahid Kapoor opened up about the pain of heartbreak. He confessed, “Sometimes, when your heart breaks, you feel you are not good enough, obviously.\" related stories He elaborated that deep love, followed by rejection, often drives people to desperate attempts to salvage the relationship. However, this pursuit, Shahid pointed out, can sometimes come at the cost of self-respect and dignity—a realization that tends to dawn only after years of introspection. Sharing a key lesson from his experiences, Shahid highlighted the importance of self-awareness and understanding the impact of a relationship. While love itself is powerful, he noted, it’s crucial to determine if the relationship fosters growth or brings out negative traits. “Ultimately, you have to live with yourself,\" he emphasized. Drawing from his personal journey, Shahid reflected on the concept of giving in relationships. “I am needy, I need to be comforted, I need to be made to feel like I am so important—these are selfish things,\" he admitted. He stressed that true love lies in giving selflessly, without seeking validation or comfort to fulfill personal needs. Shahid further explained that when both partners focus on giving, the relationship thrives naturally, with no undue pressure or expectations. However, he warned that feelings of entitlement or the tendency to demand things could lead to tension and strain in the relationship. “If something doesn’t come naturally, it might be a sign that either the person isn’t right for you, or you’re not right for them,\" he added. He also touched upon a common misconception in relationships—assuming one fully understands their partner. According to Shahid, as relationships deepen, these assumptions often break down, leading people to believe their partner has changed. “In reality, you might simply be discovering a deeper, previously unexplored side of them,\" he explained. On the professional front, Shahid Kapoor is gearing up for the release of Deva, in which he plays a cop. The film also stars Pooja Hegde, Pavail Gulati, Pravessh Rana, and Kubbra Sait. Directed by Rosshan Andrrews and produced by Siddharth Roy Kapur and Umesh KR Bansal, Deva is slated to hit theaters on January 31, 2025, promising an action-packed cinematic experience. tags : bollywood Shahid Kapoor Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 26, 2025, 14:14 IST News movies Shahid Kapoor Reveals Life Lessons From Heartbreak: ‘I Am Needy, But Love Is About Giving’ Read More",

An excerpt from the review read, “At 2 hours and 5 minutes, Sky Force makes for a crisp and taut screenplay that rarely drops pace. Kudos to the director duo, who seamlessly blend in their individual instincts and style, never once making you wonder that there are two captains sailing the ship! The film is bereft of melodramatic dialogues about desh bhakti or contrived sequences aimed to evoke sappy sentimentality. The makers manage to strike a fine balance between realism and cinematic flamboyance and they deserve brownie points for the same.\" “One of the major highlights of Sky Force is its breathtaking aerial combat sequences packed with edge-of-the-seat thrill. They may remind you of Fighter but unlike the Hrithik Roshan starrer, this one isn’t amply slick, cool and stylish, but that works with the template and mood of the film. These scenes are punctuated with moments that accentuate the valour and sacrifices made by fighter pilots,\" the review also mentioned. tags : Akshay Kumar bollywood veer pahariya Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 26, 2025, 11:36 IST News movies Sky Force Box Office: Akshay Kumar's Film Earns Rs 33.75 Crore in 2 Days Read More",

The winners of the coveted Padma Shri were announced a while back. Musicians who have been bestowed this honour include Arijit Singh, Jaspinder Narula and Ricky Kej, along with veteran actor Ashok Saraf and veteran theatre director Barry John. Speaking exclusively to News18 Showsha, Narula, who began her career with Judaai Judaai and Meri Zindagi Ek Pyaas from Sridevi, Anil Kapoor and Urmila Matondkar starrer Judaai (1997), says that she’s elated to have won this award. “Mehnat aur tapasya safal ho jaati hai jab mil jaata hai award,\" she tells us. Prior to films, she remained involved with singing bhajans and Sufiana compositions and earned acclaim for folk and devotional music. And now with the Padma Shri added to her list of awards and accolades, she feels that she has experienced the divine. “I’ve worked hard for 50 years and now I feel like god has come before me. Everybody wants to get an honour like this. Awards are meant to recognise your work and talent and they make you happy. This really means a lot and to get it from the Government of India is a very big deal,\" she remarks. related stories But does she believe that she should’ve received the Padma Shri years ago? “Samay ki baat hoti hai.

Narula, who has garnered immense appreciation for her distinctly raspy and textured voice, confesses applying for the awards as she adds, “There are so many artists who couldn’t receive it. So many deserving artists passed away before they could get a Padma Shri. I think time and destiny dictate everything. I had enrolled for it because yeh sab aaj kal toh karna hi padhta hai, uske bagair baat nahi hoti. But I was still surprised with the news.\" For the unversed, before training under Ustad Ghulam Sadiq Khan, she learnt music under the tutelage of her father, Kesar Singh Narula, a music director of the 1950s. Dedicating the award to him, she emotionally says, “If my father was alive, I would’ve dedicated it to him because he was everything to me. I’m really missing my dad and mom today. My dad was behind all this. He would help me with my riyaaz. He taught me what it means to work hard. I would tell him to not leave me because I’ve a lot left to achieve and he needs to see all of it. But unfortunately, four years ago, he left us.\" Narula’s career as a singer in films began after late music director Kalyanji of Kalyanji-Anandji fame heard her at a private gathering in Delhi and asked his son and music director, Viju Shah, to give her a break. Her discography includes popular songs like Ankhiyon Se Goli Maare (Dulhe Raja), Sabki Baaraten Aayeen (Jaanam Samjha Karo), Bumbroo (Mission Kashmir), Dulhe Ka Sehra (Dhadkan) and Bunty Aur Babli (Bunty Aur Babli), among others. tags : bollywood regional cinema Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 22:09 IST News movies Jaspinder Narula Dedicates Padma Shri To Father Kesar Singh Narula: ‘Enrolling For The Award...' | Exclusive Read More",

However, RGV has now stepped forward to dismiss these rumors, putting to rest the swirling buzz around the film’s cast.

Sharing insights about the film’s concept on X, he emphasized that while street gangs were once seen as a significant threat, the real danger today stems from the emergence of powerful syndicates. These groups, he explained, comprise a sinister nexus of political factions, law enforcement, ultra-wealthy business magnates, and even military operatives. The director also highlighted how today’s intense polarization in the country creates fertile ground for such an ominous syndicate to rise. Unlike a supernatural horror film, RGV described Syndicate as a terrifying exploration of human nature’s darkest truths and the cyclical nature of crime and terror. “Crime and terror never die; they keep coming back in deadlier forms,\" he remarked, shedding light on the chilling themes of the film. In a bold statement, RGV vowed to redeem his cinematic legacy with Syndicate. “I took a VOW to WASH AWAY all my CINEMA SINS that I committed over the PAST FEW YEARS with this JUST one SINGLE film called SYNDICATE,\" he wrote. Promising an intense and realistic narrative, he assured audiences that Syndicate would be a film that horrifies not with the supernatural, but with its unflinching portrayal of humanity’s potential for darkness. tags : amitabh bachchan bollywood fahadh faasil Ram Gopal Varma regional cinema Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 20:49 IST News movies Ram Gopal Varma Shuts Down Rumors About Amitabh Bachchan, Fahadh Faasil In Syndicate Read More",

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Sandra Bullock, the beloved Hollywood icon, has found herself in the middle of a heated legal dispute involving Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni . This has reportedly happened because of an unearthed post from months ago, sparking a bizarre twist in an already complicated saga. The drama started brewing just before Christmas when Blake Lively, 37, accused Baldoni, 40, of sexual harassment, kicking off a legal battle that quickly turned messy. To add fuel to the fire, The New York Times released an article based on Lively’s legal filings, which not only detailed her allegations but also claimed Baldoni had orchestrated a smear campaign against her. Not one to back down, Baldoni responded by suing The New York Times for defamation and filing a jaw-dropping $400 million lawsuit against Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds. He accused the Hollywood power couple of using their celebrity influence to sabotage his career and hijack his project. related stories So, where does Sandra Bullock fit into all of this? Flashback to July 2023: filming for It Ends With Us had just wrapped and Reynolds took to social media to post a cheeky birthday tribute to his The Proposal co-star. “Happy Birthday to the inimitable and stunning Sandra Bullock! For your birthday this year, I got us both intimacy coordinators. And an HR department. And clothing?\" Reynolds had written. The post also included a clip from their infamous naked scene in the film. The actor’s fans now believe the caption held more meaning than what met the eye. At the time, it seemed like a typical Reynolds quip, but in light of Lively’s reported on-set demands, it feels almost prophetic. Check it out here: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) Social media lit up with reactions. One fan commented, “The caption makes sense now,\" while others pointed out Reynolds’ apparent jab at Baldoni through the caption. According to leaked details, Lively had insisted on an intimacy coordinator being present at all times during her scenes with Baldoni. Among her 30 reported demands were strict boundaries like no improvising during kissing scenes, no biting or lip-sucking without explicit consent and ensuring all intimate interactions were “in character,\" informs Daily Mail. The drama reached new heights when Baldoni’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, released a video exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com. The footage showed multiple takes of a dance scene between Lively and Baldoni, seemingly contradicting her claims of discomfort during filming. Lively, however, countered that the video only reinforced her unease, insisting it demonstrated the very behaviour she found objectionable. Meanwhile, she and Reynolds filed a legal motion requesting a gag order on Baldoni’s attorneys. In a court filing, the couple accused Freedman of running a “harassing and retaliatory media campaign\" against them. With every twist and turn, this legal battle has managed to rope in unexpected players like Sandra Bullock and ignite a media frenzy. As Lively and Reynolds push for a protective order, Baldoni’s team shows no signs of backing down. tags : entertainment Ryan Reynolds Sandra Bullock Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 18:34 IST News movies Why Sandra Bullock Has Been Dragged Into Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively And Justin Baldoni Saga Read More",

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Imagine coming home to find that a stranger has not only invaded your personal space but has made themselves remarkably comfortable, snacking in your kitchen, taking a shower and rummaging through your belongings. For Kid Cudi, this bizarre nightmare became a reality earlier this January when an intruder reportedly broke into his Los Angeles residence. The individual, described by the rapper as a “crazed fan,\" was eventually apprehended by L.A. County Sheriff’s deputies, but the experience left a mark on Cudi. What made matters worse was seeing people on social media making jokes about the situation. Taking to Instagram Stories and X on January 23, the Ohio-born artist addressed the incident and the hurtful jokes circulating online. He began by calling out the trolls and providing a clearer picture of the unsettling ordeal. related stories “I see the internet running with things and making jokes this s*** is not funny. The person who broke into my house was a crazed fan who had been stalking me for years without me knowing. He’s been to shows, events I’ve done in the States and overseas,\" he wrote. This wasn’t just an ordinary break-in. As Cudi explained, the man had gone to extreme lengths to get to him, driving across the country in hopes of sharing ideas and pitching collaborations. But what he did after breaking in crossed all boundaries of privacy. “He rummaged through personal things, my fiancee’s stuff, took a shower and ate, all while thinking he was gonna have a conversation with me. This was an unhinged 34-year-old man,\" Cudi shared. Adding to his frustration was the incorrect assumption by some online that the intruder was homeless. Cudi firmly shut down that speculation while emphasising how this violation of his privacy has made him rethink his safety measures moving forward. “There is nothing funny about this. My privacy was violated, and now I have to protect myself. I don’t feel safe now,\" he wrote. The Grammy-winning artist also warned that this experience may affect how he interacts with fans in public. “If I’m standoffish when you see me in public now, this is why,\" he admitted.

Aamir Khan and Reena Datta’s son Junaid Khan is all set to make his big screen debut alongside Khushi Kapoor in their upcoming film ‘Loveyapa’. The actors have been busy promoting the film over the last few days. In a recent interview, Junaid revealed how he approved of his sister Ira Khan’s relationship with Nupur Shikhare. He revealed that he allowed her to date anyone, but had one condition- that the partner must have a drinking contest with him. This was a test so that Ira could see the guy at his most vulnerable, and decide whether she wants to date him. Junaid shared in detail about how the contest went, and how Nupur spent the rest of the night on the bathroom floor. He then joked that he put Nupur in bed and he ‘cuddled’ with Junaid all night. In a conversation with Hauterrfly, Junaid Khan said, “The only thing with my sister was, you can date whoever you want. But you must bring them home, and they have to have a drinking contest with me. They get to pick the liquor, and the rules are both to take a shot every 15 minutes. And if someone can’t take a shot, or someone throws up, or someone will not be able to take a shot. Those are the rules of the game, and as long as they beat me in a drinking contest, everything is fun.\" He added that the idea behind this contest was for Ira to see them at their drunkest. related stories Junaid Khan Reveals Nupur Shikhare ‘Cuddled’ With Him All Night Post Drinking Game When asked whether Nupur managed to beat Junaid, the latter replied, “Yeah! So, what happened was we started drinking, and at one point, Nupur was like, Junaid, I’m done. So, I said you take this shot and I’ll not take a shot, so then you won. He took the shot, he won and I took a video of it and it was very sweet. He spent the rest of the night on the bathroom floor with Ira next to him. That was also very sweet. Then I picked him up and I put him in bed and then he cuddled with me all night because he was in my bed.\" Ira Khan got married to Nupur Shikhare in January last year. While they registered their marriage on January 3, 2024, in Mumbai, they had a white wedding in Udaipur a few days later.

Foxx himself also stepped in to help DiCaprio embrace the uncomfortable reality of his character. reset Follow us on Google News Samuel L Jackson helped DiCaprio on the sets. (Photo Credits: Instagram) Behind the scenes of Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained, a particularly intense challenge had Leonardo DiCaprio feeling deeply uncomfortable. Jamie Foxx , who starred in the 2012 hit, recently shed light on the internal conflict DiCaprio faced while playing the cruel plantation owner Calvin Candie. The trouble began with one loaded word—one that DiCaprio’s character had to deliver multiple times throughout the film. “Leonardo DiCaprio had a problem saying it,\" Foxx revealed in a candid interview. The actor reportedly confided in his co-stars, admitting, “It’s tough for me to say this.\" “The N-word, specifically. Leo had a hard time saying the N-word,\" Foxx revealed to Vanity Fair. He further said that at that moment, Samuel L Jackson, the seasoned actor who played Calvin’s disturbingly loyal slave, Stephen, helped him. Known for his no-nonsense approach, Jackson didn’t sugarcoat his advice. As Foxx recalled, Jackson firmly told DiCaprio, “Get over it, mother******! It’s just another Tuesday, mother******!\" related stories Foxx himself also stepped in to help DiCaprio embrace the uncomfortable reality of his character. “I told Leo, ‘We are not friends. This is your property. These aren’t humans. This is your property,’\" Foxx explained. Taking the advice to heart, DiCaprio took his preparation to the next level. The next day, he reportedly arrived on set and stayed completely in character, refusing to engage with anyone outside of his role. Tarantino’s habit of incorporating racial slurs into his scripts has been a long-standing point of controversy. According to The Independent, films like Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight have drawn criticism for their liberal use of the N-word. However, Jackson, a frequent Tarantino collaborator, has often defended the director’s choices, arguing that they’re rooted in authenticity. Jackson doubled down on this sentiment in an interview with Esquire, calling out the backlash against Tarantino’s scripts. “You can’t just tell a writer he can’t talk, write the words, or put the words in the mouths of the people from their ethnicities, the way that they use their words. You cannot do that, because then it becomes an untruth; it’s not honest. It’s just not honest,\" Jackson reportedly argued. In the end, DiCaprio overcame his discomfort and delivered a chilling performance as Calvin Candie, one that remains etched in cinematic history. Thanks to the combined efforts of Foxx, Jackson and Tarantino, the film achieved a raw authenticity that sparked conversation and controversy in equal measure. tags : entertainment hollywood jamie foxx Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 17:56 IST News movies Jamie Foxx Opens Up About Leonardo DiCaprio’s Struggles On The Set Of Django Unchained Read More",

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Reuel (@ruuhmusic) Here are the excerpts: How did you come up with the idea for Gumshudah? What inspired the melody and lyrics? The idea for Gumshudah started with  JOH working on the music and beat first. Once that foundation was set, we developed the lyrics and melody. We wanted to incorporate both English and Hindi, and that duality really shaped the concept of the song. It was a very free-flowing and immediate process—one of those moments where everything just clicks. In fact, we ended up writing and composing the entire piece in just a couple of hours, which is always a great sign. After that, we sent it over to Smithy, our lyricist, to refine the lyrics. And that’s how the idea and composition of Gumshudah came to life. You mentioned that Gumshudah was initially created just for yourselves. How did it transition into becoming a part of Mismatched Season 3? Yes, we originally wrote Gumshudah as a song we wanted to release ourselves because it had a completely fresh sound—something that doesn’t exist in India, especially in Hindi. We really wanted to push this new vibe out there. Then, by some twist of fate, someone happened to play it for the showrunners of Mismatched. They listened to it and absolutely loved it! In fact, they had gone through several songs before coming across Gumshudah and immediately asked if they could use it for the show. It was all so serendipitous! What’s even crazier is that they didn’t give us any brief or ask for a single change. The song was used exactly as it was, in its original form. The song blends modern rhythms with heartfelt lyrics. How did you approach achieving this balance during the composition process? We actually came up with the melody first, even before working on the beat. The beat we ended up writing to was incredibly exciting—fresh, new, and youthful. It had this vibrant, young energy that we wanted to capture. At the same time, we aimed to make the song’s entry feel deep and emotionally resonant, while still being relatable to a younger audience. That’s why we included words like ‘forever maybe,’ which evoke a unique mental space. But then, when the song kicks in, it’s something you can totally dance to, you know! So, I think ...",

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Taylor Swift’s fans were sent into an absolute frenzy Friday morning when they noticed something shocking: both her 2006 debut album and 2017’s Reputation had reportedly vanished from Spotify. As the news spread, Swifties immediately started speculating about the cause of the strange disappearance. Some fans jumped to the conclusion that the albums had been pulled to make way for the re-recorded versions of Taylor Swift (name of her debut album) and Reputation, both albums she’s hinted at releasing for some time now. Others, more sceptical, suggested that it was all just a technical glitch, a bug in the system causing the albums to temporarily disappear. One Swiftie posted on X (formerly Twitter), “There’s no Reputation or Debut stolen version on Spotify OMG What is happening? Everybody calm down.\" In the clip, they showed the currently empty Spotify page where the albums used to be listed. Another fan account joined in saying, “’Debut’ and ‘Reputation’ were REMOVED from Taylor Swift’s Spotify page!\" And just like that, the fan base exploded with theories, questions and concerns. related stories THERE’S NO REPUTATION OR DEBUT STOLEN VERSION ON SPOTIFY OMG WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING EVERYBODY CALM DOWN pic.twitter.com/IT0R5sbo4f — TAYLA (@Ponar15) January 24, 2025 ? | “Debut\" and “reputation\" were REMOVED from Taylor Swift’s Spotify page! pic.twitter.com/2Z9AXDoqol — Taylor Swift News (@blessedswifty) January 24, 2025 By the time news outlets picked up on the situation, Swift’s debut album had reportedly reappeared on her page, but Reputation remained absent. This latest mystery adds fuel to the ongoing saga of Taylor Swift’s efforts to regain ownership of her music. Following a heated dispute with Big Machine Records and former manager Scooter Braun, Swift took the step of re-recording several of her albums to reclaim her work. So far, she’s released Fearless (Taylor’s Version), Red (Taylor’s Version), Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) and 1989 (Taylor’s Version). Fans are eagerly waiting for the next in line. Given that Reputation is one of the last albums she hasn’t re-recorded yet, many fans believe that its mysterious removal could signal that the re-recorded version is finally on its way. It’s no secret that Swift has been teasing this release for months and some speculate that the announcement could come at the Grammy Awards next month, much like her surprise reveal of The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) album at last year’s ceremony, reports Page Six. In fact, Swift’s fashion choices during the 2024 Grammy red carpet sparked more Reputation speculation. Fans noted her dark, goth-punk-inspired outfit as a nod to her Reputation era, which she once described as her “goth-punk moment of female rage.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bookish Swifties Club💜 (@bookishswiftiesclub) While it’s unclear whether the re-recorded Reputation album is dropping soon, Swift’s trademark Easter Eggs or hidden clues dropped in her music and public appearances have only added to the excitement. Fans are holding onto hope that the Grammy Awards will bring the announcement they’ve all been waiting for, especially considering that Swift used the same stage last year to drop some major news about her projects. For now, Swifties will have to stay tuned and keep a watchful eye on her every move. Could this be the calm before the storm of Reputation (Taylor’s Version)?

View this post on Instagram A post shared by HARNOOR (@harnoorhere) Here are the excerpts: “Famous\" is such a heartfelt exploration of love and nostalgia. What inspired you to write this song, and how does it reflect your personal journey? I made this song back when I was in a relationship, my partner used to doubt me a lot so I decided to write this song to win her trust and let her know what I think about her. The song transitions from a Pop-R&B rhythm to a Lofi soundscape. How did you decide on this two-part structure, and what message are you trying to convey through it? I made this song in Mexico a few years back, Arsh had made that switch and it just went crazy. My composition was fitting really well on the beat. You’ve mentioned that ‘Famous’ captures the simplicity of past moments. Can you share a specific memory that influenced the song’s lyrics or emotions? A specific memory from the song lyrics are when she told me that she talks to the moon when she’s lonely and I’m with the stars. How was the experience of working with Arsh Heer, Shraban, Mike Tucci, and the creative team for this track? We never interfere with each other’s work, we know our parts in the song and we beleive everyone knows their part the best. The visualizer for ‘Famous’ offers a glimpse into your daily life. How important is it for you to bring authenticity into your visuals, and what do you want fans to take away from them? I beleive in honesty, the industry in the west don’t usually hide their flaws and people spend a lot of money just to show off the streets This song was initially going to be just an audio release but I personally wanted a visualizer, I met my friends Pj and tej in Toronto and they killed the visualizer and this is my daily routine whenever I’m not home this is what I do. With your recent venture into songwriting, starting with “Letter to My Ex,\" how has the transition been? How does writing your own lyrics shape your connection with your music? “Letter to my ex\" is the first song I have written in a single day so it’s pretty important to me and this song is also about my first ex, it’s all about connectivity, Shraban made the melody and everything just happened next i didn’t put much effort into it, it was like my mind and heart automatically aligned with the song and the song and the things I have been wanting to say finally came out Do you find songwriting more challenging or liberating compared to performing songs written by others? I don’t feel it’s challenging, I think it’s easier writing a song by yourself, composing and singing but when you make a song with multiple minds like “sicko mode\" for example with Travis & Drake that song has a lot of writers, so I feel if there’s more people on a song it’s gonna be better. Can we expect more self-written tracks in your upcoming EP? If so, how are you pushing your boundaries as a songwriter? 100%, in the ne...",

From the sleepy, soulful town of Warrandyte to the dazzling stage of the Mahindra Blues Festival 2025, The Teskey Brothers are bringing their unmistakable blend of nostalgia-drenched blues and soul to India—and they’re doing it with style. Formed in 2008 by brothers Josh and Sam Teskey, this Australian band has been rewriting the blues playbook, infusing it with their own heartfelt authenticity and a generous dash of Aussie charm. They’re not just making music; they’re creating an experience that lingers long after the last note fades. Their story begins on the banks of the Yarra River, where they first started busking for local crowds. With nothing more than raw talent, a love for Otis Redding and Ray Charles, and a knack for crafting melodies as smooth as the river itself, they quickly captured hearts. Drawing inspiration from their picturesque surroundings, their music flows with the same emotional current—both powerful and tranquil—that defines the best of the blues. related stories Their debut album, Half Mile Harvest, is proof of their love for old-school sound. Recorded in their home studio using analog equipment, it’s as warm and timeless as a vinyl record spinning on a turntable. The album propelled them from local gigs to global acclaim, proving that their dedication to authenticity was exactly what the world was waiting for. Their sophomore effort, Run Home Slow, solidified their standing, debuting at number 2 on the ARIA Charts and earning them a well-deserved spot as one of Australia’s most cherished musical exports. What makes The Teskey Brothers stand out is their unshakable commitment to staying true to their roots. In an age dominated by digital perfection, they’ve embraced the imperfections of analog gear and the spontaneity of live performance, resulting in music that feels honest, raw, and alive. Their grassroots approach to building their career—no label, no manager, just passion and perseverance—has fostered a deep bond with their fans and earned them multiple ARIA Awards. Now, the Mahindra Blues Festival 2025 is their next big stage, and they couldn’t be more excited. For The Teskey Brothers, it’s not just about playing music; it’s about celebrating the enduring spirit of the blues and connecting with new audiences across continents. Their performance promises to be a soulful journey, blending the vintage charm of the genre with a fresh, modern perspective. In this exclusive interview with News18 Showsha, Josh Teskey dives into the band’s evolution, their connection to the blues, and what it means to bring their Australian soul to the Mahindra Blues Festival. Get ready for a story as compelling as their sound—where resilience meets rhythm, and hope finds its harmony. View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Teskey Brothers (@theteskeybrothers) Here are the excerpts: The Mahindra Blues Festival celebrates both resilience and hope. How do these themes align with your musical philosophy? Josh Teskey: Blues music, rhythm and blues music, soul music—whatever you want to call it—is a music that’s always been with us. It’s always been here, as long as you can remember, people have been singing rhythm and blues. And it’s going to stay here too. It’s never been the most popular of all music, it’s never at the very top of the pop charts, but it’s always had its place and its support. It’s timeless. That’s why we love it and can’t wait to see how the people respond to it in India firsthand. Blues has universal appeal but distinct regional flavors. What excites you most about bringing your Australian take on blues to an Indian audience? Josh Teskey: The town of Warrandyte is situated on the banks of the Yarra River, a beautiful river that influences our music in many ways. There always seem to be river analogies creeping into our lyrics and songwriting. Also, the incredible mentors and musicians of the area, of course, have played a great influence on us. Growing up in Warrandyte, how did your environment and community shape your love for soul and blues music? Josh Teskey: Artists like these are what influenced me to sing at all. The raw emotion that resonates in these voices—there’s just nothing like it. We also love the production and sounds on these records; it’s a sound we’ve always tried to aim for. What do you remember about those early days busking and performing at local venues? Are there any standout moments that you look back on fondly? Josh Teskey: It was never...",

Taj’s journey from a star-struck kid at an AC/DC concert to a viral sensation is nothing short of extraordinary.

Get ready to meet the future of blues—and don’t be surprised if he leaves you tapping your feet and dreaming big. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Taj Farrant (@tajfarrant) Here are the excerpts: As one of the youngest artists at the Mahindra Blues Festival, how do you feel about sharing the stage with legends of the genre? I feel honoured! Especially knowing that Buddy Guy has played at this festival a few times before. Blues is often considered a medium of storytelling. What stories are you most excited to share through your music at this festival? One thing I get a lot is that I’m too young to know what the Blues is about, so I guess my main story is that you don’t have to be old to be able to sing or play the Blues. Blues, for me, is about feeling the music and conveying that feeling to the listeners. What does performing at a festival that celebrates the future of blues alongside its rich heritage mean to you personally? This is a huge deal; it means that Blues is still very much alive, even though it might not be as mainstream as it should be. You’ve credited an AC/DC concert as the spark that ignited your passion for the guitar. What was it about Angus Young’s performance that captivated you so deeply? This is a hard one; there’s not one particular answer. When I saw Angus come up through the stage, I just knew straight away that that was what I wanted to do. There was just something about watching Angus that made me want to play guitar from that moment. Your father learned to play the guitar to help you pursue your passion. How did that influence your journey as a musician? Definitely Dad’s taste in music! I remember listening to Thin Lizzy and asking Dad who the guitarist was, and that was when we went down the YouTube rabbit hole of watching Gary Moore! At just 15, your music has been described as seasoned and mature. How do you channel such depth and emotion into your playing at such a young age? I don’t know to be honest, I just play because I love playing. Your music fuses blues and rock with soulful expression. How do you approach blending these genres into a cohesive sound? This answer is going to sound crazy, but I listen to a lot of rap and R&B. Those two genres have a different way of phrasing, and that helps me blend blues and rock into the way I like to play it. Chapter One has received significant acclaim. Can you share the inspiration and creative journey behind the album? Thank you. Chapter One is, well, the start of my music career. Each song on the album is a small story about my journey and how we moved from Australia to the US, but each song was written in a way so that anybody could r...",

There was a drunk man sitting right in front of us. For some reason, he began to abuse us, taking our names. I was furious looking at this. I said Jeetendra, ‘Jeetu, I think we should speak to him.’ Jeetu said, ‘Let’s go. Let’s keep quiet. We don’t know him, he knows us. So we are soft targets.’ So, we walked away from there.

The victims—7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, 6-year-old Bebe King, and 9-year-old Alice da Silva Aguiar—lost their lives, while eight other children and two adults were injured. During the trial, Judge Julian Goose explained that, as Rudakubana was a minor at the time of the crime, he could not receive a life sentence without parole. Instead, he was handed a lengthy sentence to reflect the severity of his actions. According to the Associated Press (AP), Goose stated that Rudakubana “wanted to try and carry out mass murder of innocent, happy young girls.\" During the trial at Liverpool Crown Court, when prosecutors began showing evidence, the attacker interrupted them by claiming he was feeling ill and asked for a doctor.

The trial continued without Rudakubana, where he was charged with three murders, ten attempted murders and other offences, including having a knife, ricin poison and an al-Qaida manual. related stories Prosecutor Deanna Heer explained that during the summer vacation, 26 young girls were sitting together, making bracelets and singing Taylor Swift songs. The suspect arrived at the Hart Space venue in a taxi. Holding a knife, he entered the building and started attacking the girls and their teacher brutally. Heer claimed two dead children “suffered particularly horrific injuries which are difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature.\" Reportedly, one girl managed to reach the exit, but the attacker pulled her back inside. While she was shockingly stabbed 32 times but survived. One of the girls who couldn’t survive, had 122 injuries, while another had 85 wounds. The prosecutor further shed light on Axel Rudakubana’s long history of violence and killing. According to Deanna Heer, “His only purpose was to kill. And he targeted the youngest and most vulnerable in society.\" While in the police station, the 18-year-old was heard saying “It’s a good thing those children are dead, I’m so glad, I’m so happy.\" This was heard in front of the victims’ families present in the courtroom. tags : entertainment hollywood Taylor Swift Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 16:43 IST News movies Teen Sentenced To 52 Years For Killing 3 Young Taylor Swift Fans At UK Dance Class Read More",

(Photo Credits: Instagram) After years of intense scrutiny and a lengthy investigation, shock rocker Marilyn Manson will reportedly not face criminal charges for allegations of rape and domestic violence. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office announced the decision on Friday, bringing an official close to the four-year investigation into accusations levelled against Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner. In a detailed statement, District Attorney Nathan J Hochman explained the decision, citing two primary factors: the expiration of the statute of limitations on the domestic violence claims and insufficient evidence to prove sexual assault charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The investigation was a collaborative effort between the DA’s Sex Crimes Division and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, reports Entertainment Weekly. related stories “We recognise and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation,\" the statement read. The DA’s office further emphasised the importance of the survivors’ advocacy, noting how their voices have shone a light on the obstacles faced by those who endure domestic abuse and sexual violence. While no charges will be filed, Hochman reportedly reaffirmed the office’s dedication to pursuing justice for survivors. “We encourage anyone experiencing abuse to seek support and make a report to law enforcement as quickly as possible,\" the statement concluded. Manson’s attorney, Howard King, expressed relief at the outcome, stating, “We are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start: Brian Warner is innocent.\" Manson, now 56, has been at the centre of multiple allegations in recent years. High-profile accusations reportedly came from actress and former fiancee Evan Rachel Wood and Game of Thrones star Esme Bianco. Wood accused Manson of grooming her as a teenager and subjecting her to horrific abuse during their relationship, which she detailed in the 2022 HBO documentary Phoenix Rising. She also alleged that Manson “essentially raped\" her during the filming of his Heart-Shaped Glasses music video. In response, Manson filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood in 2022 but later dropped the case, agreeing to pay her legal fees. Bianco filed her own civil lawsuit in 2021, accusing Manson of sexual assault and human trafficking. That case was settled in 2023, informs Entertainment Weekly. Reacting to the DA’s decision not to press charges, Bianco shared her disappointment but acknowledged it didn’t come as a surprise. “Once again, our justice system has failed survivors,\" she wrote in a social media post on Friday. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Esmé Bianco (@esmebianco) “My healing and peace could not be reliant upon the outcome of a desperately broken system.\" She ended her message with a pointed note directed at Manson. “By you dragging me through hell, I discovered the unstoppable force of my own power,\" her statement read. tags : entertainment hollywood marilyn manson Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 16:25 IST News movies No Charges Filed Against Marilyn Manson Following Rape And Domestic Violence Claims, Here's Why Read More",

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Big Oomp Records (@bigoomprecords) DJ Unk’s Career It is noteworthy that Unk suffered certain health issues in 2009 which significantly affected his music career. Speaking to the XXL Magazine in 2010, Unk revealed he suffered from heart attack. “Basically man, I work hard every day. Everything I do every day I try to make something happen in my household. I constantly am on the go, I constantly am on airplanes, in different weather and you know it just took a toll on me. It was stress,\" he said. DJ Unk began his musical career at the very young age of 17, linking up with DJ Jelly and DJ Montay. He later signed with Big Oomp Records and released his debut album Beat’n Down Yo Block in 2006. Unk’s 2006 debut single Walk It Out also came around the same time, becoming a major hit. It climbed to No.10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 2 on Hot Rap Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. However, it was his 2009 illness that slowed down Unk’s career in the following years with a few one-off singles and a full-length titled Fresh Off Dem Papers. The rapper most recently appeared on the stage at the BET Awards last year to perform Walk It Out as a part of a medley.

Urvashi Rautela hit the headlines last week after she faced flak for her comments about Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan’s attack. While condemning the attack, the actress shifted the conversation to discuss expensive gifts that her parents had given her after the success of her film ‘Daaku Maharaaj’. She flaunted her diamond-studded Rolex and other jewellery, which many found tone-deaf and insensitive. She then apologized on Instagram, but later deleted the post. Now, in a recent interview, Urvashi explained that she was caught off guard and was unaware of the full details of the attack on Saif Ali Khan. While speaking with Filmfare, Urvashi Rautela said that the question about Saif Ali Khan caught her off guard because the attack happened at 4 am, and she had an interview the next morning while she was still processing the news. “I think I should have been way more careful with the way I answered. I have to admit that I should have answered it more carefully. Also, the incident happened at 4 am (Saif’s attack), and very next day my interviews happened at 8 am. So, I was completely kind of clueless. All I remember is that when I was waking up someone told me, he got hurt. I don’t know the intensity of how he got hurt. I wasn’t aware of the intensity of what all has happened with him,\" she said. related stories She said that she kept bringing up her film Daaku Maharaaj as the interviews were lined up to celebrate the success of her film. She also admitted that the excitement about her parents’ gifts caused her to go off-topic, and that it was a moment of misplaced enthusiasm rather than an attempt to ‘show-off’.  “I came back to my film Daaku Maharaaj because the interviews were to celebrate its success. Unlike what some people think, I was also not referring to that daaku (intruder) as a maharaaj. I love my parents; I feel they are my god. I got a bit too excited with the kind of gifts I got. Hum Hindi mai bolte hai na, josh mai hosh kho dena. Wahi hua mere saath. But show off toh nahi tha. Kyunki agar show off hota toh main chhoti si mini watch nahi dikhaati. (Like we say in Hindi, I lost it in the passion, that’s what happened. It was definitely not show off. Because if it was, I wouldn’t have shown a small mini watch),\" said Urvashi. What Did Urvashi Rautela Say About Attack On Saif Ali Khan? In an interview with ANI, Urvashi was asked to comment on Saif’s situation. While expressing concern, her remarks veered towards showcasing her luxury items. Referring to the attack at Saif’s Mumbai residence, Urvashi said, “It is very unfortunate. Now Daaku Maharaaj has crossed ₹105 crore at the box office, and my mother gifted me this diamond-studded Rolex, while my father gifted me this mini watch on my finger, but we don’t feel confident wearing it outside openly. There is this insecurity that anybody can attack us. Whatever happened was very unfortunate.\" For the unversed, Saif Ali Khan was stabbed by an intruder who allegedly broke into his Mumbai residence on January 16. The actor suffered multiple injuries, including one near his spine and another on his neck. He was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where he underwent surgeries. tags : bollywood Saif ali khan Urvashi Rautela Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 16:05 IST News movies Urvashi Rautela REACTS To Her Comments On Saif Ali Khan Attack: ‘Show Off Hota Toh Mini Watch Nahi Dikhaati’ Read More",

Sometimes life puts you in a situation where it plays out in a way where somebody is… you’re in enclosed proximity and you’re made to feel lesser. It’s nobody’s fault, I’m not getting into that. But that is what I went through for some time. And I was made to feel like that. And I fought it.\" Shahid had once said that he felt like an outsider on the sets of Padmaavat. He had told DNA, “I’m used to being the favourite of all my filmmakers. This was the first time that I was like an outsider. When you work with a team that has worked together, you are kind of an outsider and it takes time for you to break through that barrier.\" tags : bollywood Shahid Kapoor Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 15:04 IST News movies Shahid Kapoor Was Made To Feel Less Of A Star Before Kabir Singh: 'Mujhe Aise Situation Mein Dala Gaya...'

(Photo Credits: Instagram) The simmering feud between Justin Baldoni and Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds has taken a sharp turn, with Baldoni’s camp calling out what they see as a shocking double standard. They’re pushing back against the couple’s attempt to silence Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, through a gag order, describing the move as nothing short of grossly unfair. The tension reportedly escalated after Lively’s sexual harassment claims, initially published by The New York Times, sparked widespread attention. Now, Baldoni’s camp is calling out what they see as an attempt to silence Freedman, who has been vocal in defending his client. “It’s grossly unfair,\" insiders close to the It Ends With Us director reportedly said, adding that the couple’s motion to prevent Freedman from speaking to the media is “unbelievable.\" According to sources, Freedman has merely been pushing back against what they describe as Lively’s alleged “takedown campaign.\" related stories Meanwhile, representatives for Lively, 37, and Reynolds, 48, have yet to address the brewing controversy publicly, reports Page Six. The power couple has officially requested a protective order to stop Freedman from sharing any discovery materials with the press. In a letter to Judge Lewis J Liman on Tuesday, Lively’s legal team argued that Freedman’s public commentary could jeopardise the integrity of a potential trial. “As Ms Lively’s counsel have attempted, repeatedly, to caution Mr Freedman, federal litigation must be conducted in court and according to the relevant rules of professional conduct,\" the letter states, according to various reports. The letter reportedly accuses Freedman of engaging in a relentless media blitz. It claims he has given interviews, appeared on podcasts, issued “inflammatory\" statements and leaked documents, some as seemingly minor as preservation demands, to the entertainment press and tabloids “almost daily\" since Lively filed her complaint on December 20. Furthermore, the couple’s legal team alleges that Freedman’s actions are “deliberately aimed at undermining the ‘character, credibility and reputation’ of numerous relevant parties,\" informs Page Six. This legal clash follows Baldoni’s release of raw footage from It Ends With Us, which he claims discredits Lively’s allegations. Baldoni, 40, has vehemently denied the harassment claims and is reportedly preparing to launch a website aimed at dismantling what his team sees as baseless accusations against him. With both sides locked in an increasingly bitter battle, the case is shaping up to be as dramatic as any screenplay. Whether the judge will grant Lively and Reynolds’ gag order remains to be seen, but it’s clear that neither party is backing down anytime soon. tags : Blake Lively entertainment Ryan Reynolds Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 14:26 IST News movies Justin Baldoni Hits Back At Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds' Gag Order Request Read More",

In Gandhi camp, not only the streets but the premises of government buildings, including the Basti Vikas Kendra of Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), were strewn with garbage. (Nivedita Singh/News18) “The garbage is picked up from the main road once in a while. But there is no arrangement for the inner lanes,\" said Saira Alam. Her elderly neighbour, Fatima, said the drains were not covered in the locality, posing a risk for children playing outside. “We don’t have space in our homes. Whatever open space is available is turned into a dumping zone that is never cleared. The drains are open and our children have to play around it. Don’t we deserve a better life?\" she asked. For Imran, another local, the locality is in a bad shape because people are not trying to improve. “No one is dumping the garbage here other than the locals. It is not that this is coming from someone from the outside. The locals are not doing anything to ensure that the roads and spaces around it are clean and garbage-free,\" he said. The situation was no better in Kalicharan camp, with open drains and garbage on roads. In between the two camps is the Okhla fruit and vegetable market and the Okhla Railway station in Sriniwaspuri. The roads around these colonies were broken and roadside spaces were filled with garbage. These two colonies, however, do not paint the entire picture of Kalkaji as the seat also covers some of the poshest areas of Delhi, including East of Kailash, Maharani Bagh, New Friends Colony, and Kalkaji. Locals said the drains were not covered in the locality, posing a risk for children playing outside. (Nivedita Singh/News18) On the other side of Captain Gaur Marg is Sant Nagar in East of Kailash. The houses around the Raja Dhirsain Marg in Sant Nagar belong to middle and upper-middle class families. Even though sanitation is not a major issue in the lanes, it’s not rare to spot garbage on roadsides, empty plots and dividers. For the people of this area, traffic is a bigger nuisance. In the lanes, there is hardly any space to move a car as both sides are encroached with unauthorised parking. “Last year, my father fell and had to be taken to a hospital. There was no way an ambulance could come till our house. We had to carry him till the main road. These are all houses of rich people with big cars but everyone parks their car on the road, leaving hardly any space,\" said 40-year-old Surya Pandey. The roads in major parts of Kalkaji face issues of encroachment and illegal parking. Can Atishi Repeat 2020? Kalkaji assembly, a part of South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, falls under the South East district and has 1.94 lakh voters — 1.06 lakh men and 87,617 women. In 2015, AAP’s Avtar Singh won from the seat and was replaced by Atishi in 2020, giving a marginal increase in the party’s vote share. Between 1998 and 2008, Congress leader Subhash Chopra had bagged the seat. However, the party could not manage to win again after that. This time, the party has trusted Alka Lamba from the seat. Lamba, who was an AAP MLA from Chandni Chowk in 2015, said people were forced to live without basic amenities and were troubled by both AAP and BJP. “On February 5, voters from all the classes in Kalkaji will vote for the Congress… This time, the voters will not fall for the lies of AAP and BJP but on the guarantees of Congress,\" Lamba said, adding that people are tired of broken roads and overflowing sewage in the constituency and that people have realised voting for Congress is the way forward.

BJP's Kapil Mishra is aiming to address these. The 2020 Delhi riots and AIMIM's nomination of accused Tahir Hussain from neighbouring Mustafabad have polarised voters. reset Follow us on Google News BJP's Kapil Mishra campaigning in the bylanes of Karawal Nagar. (Image: News18) The distance between Karawal Nagar and Connaught Place is 19 km, but once you reach there, it seems, you have reached a different India — Tier III with no municipalities and barely any civic sense. It just needs a five-minute stroll in the area to point out the two key dominating issues of Karawal Nagar – overflowing drains, which are at some point bigger than the roads and the abysmal quality of roads that should not be qualified to be called one. It transports you to the nineties’ Uttar Pradesh where finding any 50-metre stretch of straight road would be quite a job. But Karawal Nagar does exactly that for you even in 2025 and BJP’s Kapil Mishra with a beaming smile promises to change both. related stories Open Drains are a lingering problem of Karawal Nagar THE ARITHMETIC OF THE SEAT According to the 2011 census, Karawal Nagar had a population of 224,281. Hinduism is the majority religion in Karawal Nagar city with 88.88 per cent followers. Islam is the second most popular religion in Karawal Nagar with approximately 10.44 per cent following it. That makes a whopping 23,421 Muslim voters in the seat. However, locals believe the number of Muslim voters is much higher, but they do not have any findings to back their claim. Minority voters in Karawal Nagar Among Hindus, Pahadis, Gujjars and backward classes have a significant presence in this assembly seat. Because of this, Mohan Singh Bisht — a Pahadi and sitting MLA from the seat – who was dropped, turned a rebel. the BJP understood the sensitivity of the matter and came out with a third list with just Bisht’s name offering him Mustafabad — the neighbouring seat – as a peace deal. Not taking any chance, BJP’s Kapil Mishra got Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami to campaign for him to send out the right signal to the crucial Pahadi community here. With Mishra on his side, Dhami said, “The Yamuna which flows clean and pure in Uttarakhand turns into a drain as soon as it reaches Delhi. The water of Mother Yamuna in Delhi is not fit for irrigation, let alone drinking.\" 2020 RIOTS ON THEIR MIND? It was 3 pm and Mukhram Singh was having a plate of kachori and hot sabzi as lunch. Ironically, Singh was an auto driver — a segment who was the biggest proponent of former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. But if one asks him to list the problems of Karawal Nagar, he will go on, knowing the sitting MLA was from the BJP. However, he says, he will vote for Mishra, given AAP’s role, to be more specific AAP candidate Manoj Tyagi’s alleged role, in the Delhi riots that rocked the North East belt of the national capital. “I remember what they have done. I remember the CM went to certain victims’ houses selectively. Yes, there are problems with drains and roads and if they won’t be sorted, we will change Mishra next time. But we will vote for BJP,\" he said biting his kachori and sitting inside his auto. Mukhram Singh, an auto driver said voters of North East likely to vote on religious lines. For 70-year-old Pushkal Ji, the choice is simple — the candidate doesn’t matter, the party does. “Here they are giving so much for free. Yogi (Adityanath) does not need to give anything for free. His work speaks for itself. Even if AAP gave me Rs 1 lakh, I won’t vote for them,\" he said. For this 70 year old, candidate doesn’t matter as long as he is from BJP. Scattered around Karawal Nagar, paramilitary forces could be spotted. When enquired, locals said, they arrived this morning, “probably due to Republic Day\". But a long stroll will expose a pattern, they were stationed only in front of religious places like temples, presumably to avert any tension. This reporter caught hold of a Pujari of the Shiv Temple of the Main Chowk of Karawal Nagar, who refused to be named. He told the reporter, much of the seat is likely to vote on religious lines.

At one time, the minority card was with the Congress. But not any more, just like it is in the rest of the country where voters have found other options – like the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Bengal, Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh, and Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM down south. But as the Congress party heads into the Delhi battle a little bit too late, it’s the M factor which they want to target. The reason is also long term. The party is hoping to bounce back riding high on the formula of – Dalits, Muslims, OBCs. related stories It’s not without a reason that Congress MP Rahul Gandhi chose Seelampur as his first campaign stop in Delhi. The area is minority dominated. He wanted to ensure that the Muslims feel assured that he and the Congress are with them. “ Samvidhan khatre mein hai \" or the “Constitution is under threat\" is also a narrative which is being pushed with an eye on these votes. Sources say that when Rahul Gandhi hits the campaign trail again, he is expected to address at least two more rallies in Muslim dominated areas. A feedback given is that the Hindutva push has made the minorities unsure of the Congress. The Congress now knows that the Hindu vote is unlikely to be impressed by the Gandhis’ trips to temples. So it’s back to basics again. At a closed door meeting of the Congress when seats were being discussed, Rahul Gandhi had intervened to make the point that Ishrat Jahan, the Delhi 2020 riots accused, need not be overlooked for tickets.

The Congress plans to approach the Election Commission of India over the release of this movie.

(Image: News18 & PTI) The New Delhi Assembly seat is one of the largest seats in Delhi in terms of area. However, this is the second smallest seat in terms of vote count. But when it comes to its VVIP stature, no seat comes close. This election, the seat is witnessing two sons of former Chief Ministers and a former CM himself engaged in a triangular ‘Battle Royale’. While former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Sahib Singh’s son Parvesh Verma and Sheila Dikshit’s son Sandeep Dikshit are the main contenders from the AAP, BJP and Congress respectively, there are a total of 23 contenders trying their luck from the seat. Kejriwal has been an MLA from this seat three times and this is the fourth time he has filed his nomination. related stories 2 NEW DELHIS — OF OFFICERS & SLUMS There were 1,46,000 voters here in 2020. Now this number is around 1,90,000. Most of the government offices are here, and most officers reside in this area and have voting rights in this seat. But New Delhi is not just about officers, it has another side — group D staff, and slums. This unique constituency has residences of union ministers, and members of Parliaments while housing their help on the back of their official residences. Government high risers like MS flats that house MPs, accommodate their helps in the rear section in the staff quarters. Everyone has a voting right, which makes them equal during elections. There are also a significant number of Other Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes in this assembly seat. The seat also has a fair number of voters from the Dhobi community. During campaigning, every political party reaches out to every section of the society. While many MPs don’t have voting rights here but in their respective constituencies , their staff and their families become an ideal catch for parties of all hues. ISSUES FOR NEW DELHI There is no dearth of issues in Delhi. But as long as one is in New Delhi, there are primarily three issues. But it all depends on which New Delhi is one talking about — Todarmal Road, Bengali Market, Mathura Road, Khan Market or Balmiki Mandir, Dhobi Ghat, Staff quarters of MS flats or JJ Clusters at ITO? The residents of the former will be vocal about air pollution. However, the moment you approach residents of the latter, jobs top their concerns. But the roughly 15,000 Dhobis or the washermen of New Delhi are not happy with the AAP given their long-standing complaints have never been heard. But Kejriwal realised that it could hurt him and announced, “If our government is formed, the Delhi government will establish a ‘Dhobi Samuday Welfare Board’. The dhobi community does not have a single platform to voice their issues.\" He also promised the youth from the Dhobi community to provide skill training for their traditional profession. This seems to have contained the damage, gauging the emotion of Bhurelal, who has been in this profession for ages, “He seems sincere. I will give him another chance.\" THE CAMPAIGN Though this is a three-way battle, the campaign has seen a sharp fight between the BJP and the AAP where much is at stake for the AAP National Convenor. Unlike previous elections, Kejriwal is not joking with his voters. Instead, a rattled AAP has complained against Parvesh Verma for distributing freebies, which Verma rubbished . This reporter caught Parvesh Verma catching some breath in between a non-stop door-to-door campaign and filling his stomach with sweet potatoes which he bought from the roadside. “We will win easily. Kejriwal will face not just defeat but a humiliating defeat this time. People are angry at the extent of corruption he has indulged in,\" said Verma while brisk walking. He added that pollution is a key election issue which the AAP government has much to answer for according to him. Sandeep Dikshit, whose mother Sheila Dikshit used to represent this constituency once and is running a spirited campaign for Congress, alleged, “Money is being distributed… both BJP, AAP are involved in this.\" He is leaning back to his mother’s legacy of the good old days when he claims promises were delivered. X FACTOR So, the legitimate question is, who has an edge? There is one X factor that will play an important role in deciding that — the Balmikis — around 20,000 of them in this constituency scattered around who can influence and switch verdicts. On Mandir Marg, there is a Balmiki Mandir where this reporter spent an hour with the residents who were basking in t...",

There was no immediate reaction from the BJP or the Delhi Police to the allegation. related stories Addressing a press conference here, Delhi Chief Minister Atishi and her Punjab counterpart, Bhagwant Mann, said they have written to the EC demanding “fair grounds\" for the AAP in the February 5 Delhi Assembly polls and the restoration of Kejriwal’s security cover given by the Punjab Police, along with an audit of “life-threatening\" attacks on him. They alleged that the Delhi Police, which comes under the Centre, has turned a blind eye on the alleged attacks on Kejriwal in accordance with Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s order. “There are two players involved in this conspiracy to kill Kejriwalji — the BJP and the Delhi Police. They are both conspiring to end Kejriwal’s life. Attacks have been attempted on him one after the other. In October (last year), an attack was made on Kejriwal. Upon investigation by us, it was found that the attackers were BJP workers, but police took no action,\" Atishi alleged. “We have written to the EC demanding that Kejriwal’s security be restored. We do not trust the Delhi Police as it is under Amit Shah’s control,\" she added. The AAP leaders alleged that resorting to “dirty politics\" ahead of the Delhi polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has conspired to get Kejriwal’s security removed. “We write to you with utmost urgency and grave concern regarding the security arrangements of Arvind Kejriwal, ex-chief minister of Delhi and the national convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), who has been consistently facing grave threats to his life and deliberate lapses in his security detail. “These lapses are not isolated incidents but appear to be part of a larger, orchestrated pattern designed to jeopardise his safety,\" the letter written by the AAP leaders to the EC read. It alleged that on different occasions over the last three months, multiple targeted attacks on Kejriwal, including incidents of physical assault and stone pelting during a political rally, were attempted, exacerbating their concerns. The letter complained that police “simply acted as mute spectators\" and did not make an attempt to protect Kejriwal. The chief ministers called the Union home ministry’s reported order to withdraw the Punjab Police’s security cover for Kejriwal in Delhi a “politically-motivated\" decision. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) reportedly asked to withdraw the Punjab Police’s security cover for Kejriwal in Delhi as he already enjoys Z-plus security here. “The Punjab Police, which has been a crucial and reliable component of his security detail, has been abruptly withdrawn without consultation or justification. This reckless and politically-motivated decision has left Kejriwal entirely dependent on the Delhi Police — a force directly controlled by the BJP through its government at the Centre,\" they said in the letter. Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav on Thursday said the police personnel from his state deployed for Kejriwal’s security have been withdrawn. “Following directions from the Delhi Police and the EC, we withdrew the component of the Punjab Police in the security of Kejriwalji,\" Yadav said. The AAP leaders urged the EC to “conduct an immediate and thorough review of Arvind Kejriwal’s security arrangements and implement robust measures to ensure his safety\" and “reinstate or augment the presence of the Punjab Police in his security detail to provide reliable and impartial protection\". At the press conference, Mann argued that BJP leaders like Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath receive protection from other states when they require it. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “Those who receive Z-plus security are supposed to be provided protection.

She had told me that she does not trust central forces. So we had provided security to her and charged money for it,\" Mann said.

(X) As Delhi gears up for the 2025 assembly polls on February 5, the Congress is confident that it will win over 60 seats and form a government. The grand old party had three consecutive governments in Delhi between 1998 and 2008 with a clear majority. However, after the 2015 elections, it was not able to win even a single seat in the 70-member assembly. News18 spoke to Satish Luthra, party’s candidate from the Shakur Basti assembly seat , who claimed the sweeping victory of the Congress in Delhi. He also said the Congress is ready to provide a stable and effective government. related stories “The Congress is expecting to get more than 60 seats in the Delhi elections.

BOTH AAP, BJP DID NO DEVELOPMENT: LUTHRA Attacking outgoing AAP MLA Satyendar Jain, Luthra said despite being the health minister, Jain did not develop the health infrastructure in his own constituency. “He had been behind bars for months and years. No development on roads, water sanitation, health and education has been done. Jain was involved in corruption only,\" he said. When asked who his main contest is in the elections, Luthra said he is not considering any party – the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and AAP –  a challenge. He accused Jain of being involved in corruption, while BJP’s Karnail Singh is an outsider. He said the public doesn’t want corrupt representatives. “Jain was involved in corruption scandals, including money laundering and the liquor scam. On the other hand, Singh is an outsider who isn’t familiar with the local issues of Basti. There is no possibility for him to work on the ground level,\" he explained. Luthra went on to say that both AAP and BJP are responsible for the lack of development in Delhi. He cited a 2015 report “Jostling for Jhuggi Land,\" published in Down to Earth, explaining how thousands of the city’s most vulnerable were thrown into homelessness under BJP’s central leadership and AAP’s state governance. “The report documented the anguish of those displaced due to political indifference and endless blame games. Today, history is set to repeat itself as fresh demolition orders once again threaten the very existence of Delhi’s marginalised residents. Instead of protecting the poor, they left them abandoned, caught in a crossfire of excuses and posturing,\" Luthra said. On what feedback he is getting from the public, Luthra said during his engagement with people, he has come to realise that people are looking for change as they are fed up with the present government’s lies and blame games. IMPROVED ROADS, SEWAGE ON PRIORITY When asked what his vision for the seat is, Luthra said he aims to make Shakur Basti a model constituency in Delhi and plans to focus on providing clean water, a proper drainage and sewage system, improved road infrastructure and proper parking facilities and reducing pollution. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “I also aim to improve the constituency’s health infrastructure, ensuring that residents can proudly say they live in the best and cleanest constituency in Delhi.

Jain was also the cabinet minister in the Delhi government. Despite being a high-profile seat with a Cabinet Minister, the condition of the areas in the constituency seems miserable with issues including congestion, unrepaired and dug roads and roadside dumping of garbage. While a section of people blames it on the BJP for arresting Jain and impacting the work, another section blames it on both BJP and AAP for only indulging in fighting and not caring about the issues on ground. related stories Jain lives in Saraswati Vihar. The streets around his house were dug to install sewer lines. However, weeks, months and years went by but the condition turned worse. “Earlier, the issue was the lack of a sewer line. Now, the lanes are dug and remain unrepaired. In many parts even the sewer work is not completed. The work in a major section of the area was done by Jain in months earlier. Then he was arrested. If that had not happened, this work would have also been completed by now. By arresting the MLA, the BJP hampered the work in the area,\" said Santosh Mohan from C block in Saraswati Vihar. For a shop owner near Sir Chotu Ram Chowk in Saraswati Vihar, the battle between the AAP and BJP is not helping anyone but the voters are the ones who are impacted in reality. “I have not seen any good from the kind of fights between the two parties. None of them are bothered about the real issues on ground. There is water logging on roads even when there are no rains. The business is getting impacted due to these reasons. Why will anyone come to our shops if the drain water is flowing on the road? Who will we compensate for our loss,\" Dhirender Arora, in his 50s, said. A little walk around Mahatma Hansraj Marg is enough to spot the garbage getting piled up on the road side, inviting cows and dogs. The Ramlila Ground in Pitampura throughout the year remains a dumping ground and is cleaned only once in a while. For Amar Baweja, a resident of Jyoti Apartment next to the ground, the stray animals became a major issue, even causing accidents. “Last month, my son got injured on his way back home on bicycle. Two cows were fighting on the road and he was hurt as one of the animals hit him. This has become an everyday issue,\" he said. The area around Shakur Basti railway station is in a similar condition. Balbir Singh Sidhu Marg, the road next to the railway line, leading to the Railway Colony, is not just facing a garbage issue but also illegal parking. Kamlesh Jain, a resident of Multan Nagar, said the road has been encroached illegally. And the little space in between cars is either used for a small shop or garbage dumping points. “Crossing the road in peak office hours is a nightmare. Sometimes it takes more than 40 minutes to drive one kilometer. There is no check on why a complete lane on the road is encroached,\" he said. News18 also visited parts of Meera Bagh, Peeragarhi and Rani Bagh and the situation was no better in these areas. In all these areas, either there were no footpaths or were encroached. In some places, stalls covered the footpath while some people were living on them. The Shakur Basti assembly seat falls under the North District. It has 1.56 lakh voters – 79,753 men and 76,595 women. It falls under the Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha. Will Jain get elected for a fourth term? Jain has an appeal among the voters in the area. His vote share has consistently improved in the last three elections held in 2013 (42 per cent), 2015 (49 per cent) and 2020 (52 per cent). He bagged more than 51,000 votes in the last two elections.

(ANI) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday challenged Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal and his ministers to take a bath in the Yamuna, referring to the high levels of pollutants and untreated sewage in the river that has been a political flashpoint between AAP and BJP for years. “If as a Chief Minister, I and my ministers can take a dip in the Sangam in Prayagraj, then I want to ask the president of Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, can he go and take a bath in Yamuna with his ministers?\" Adityanath said during a public rally in Delhi. “If he has moral courage, he should respond,\" related stories The UP CM’s remarks came after he took a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam during the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, along with deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya, Brajesh Pathak, and other cabinet ministers. CM Yogi further attacked Kejriwal over his failed promises to clean Yamuna, saying he should not be forgiven by the public. “These people have turned Delhi into a garbage dump. In recent days, Kejriwal has started taking repeatedly about Uttar Pradesh, but he should not forget that now people are looking at Uttar Pradesh as a model,\" Adityanath remarked. “They settled Bangladeshi infiltrators, Rohingyas here. These Bangladeshi infiltrators are being given Aadhaar cards through Aadhaar-making machines in the houses of Aam Aadmi Party leaders… Today, go and see the roads of Delhi and Noida, you will see the difference,\" he added. He said earlier people used to flock to Delhi for its Metro, road infrastructure and cleanliness, but under Kejriwal’s regime, it is impossible to say if “there is a pothole on the road or the road is in the pothole\". Kejriwal Hits Back At CM Yogi Within minutes, Kejriwal hit back at Adityanath’s challenge, saying that he has not been able to improve the condition of government schools in Uttar Pradesh despite being in power for 10 years. “Govt schools are the worst in all 20 BJP ruled states. I’d suggest Yogi to take some lessons from our minister. We can send our education minister to UP to teach BJP how to improve educational infrastructure. We want UP government schools to be improved,\" he said during a public meeting in Hari Nagar. The former Delhi CM asserted that AAP has ensured 24×7 electricity in the national capital over the last 10 years of its regime. “BJP has been ruling UP for the past 10 years and with all humility, I want to ask Yogi ji, can he explain the long powercuts across his state? There are 10-hour powercuts in entire UP. What Kejriwal has done in Delhi, BJP could not do in even in a single of the 20 states they rule!\" He also warned Delhiites to not press the “wrong button\" during the February 5 elections, saying the saffron party will “switch off your lights and fans\" permanently. Kejriwal Acknowledges 3 ‘Unfulfilled Promises’ Last week, Kejriwal admitted that he could not fulfil three promises – cleaning of Yamuna river, providing clean drinking water and making Delhi’s roads of European standard. He said these tasks will be carried out in the next five years if AAP is re-elected in the assembly polls. Addressing a gathering in Laxmi Bai Nagar, Kejriwal said, “I am truthful to my promises.

While the main roads in most areas may look good, the interior streets have a different story to tell. News18 visited various parts of the neighbourhood and noticed garbage dumped on the roads and empty plots, inviting stray animals and posing health hazards. related stories Voters voice concerns Shantanu Arya from Rohini’s Taj Apartment on Badli Road said they are facing problems of garbage accumulation and an increase in stray animals. These animals sometimes attack young children, he said. “There is a DDA land next to my place of residence. And it is turning into a dumping ground with no steps being taken to stop it. It is cleaned once in a while but ends up looking the same,\" he said. Even in the C-D Block of sector 15, with posh houses nearby, the problem persists. Empty plots are being used as dumping zones and attract cattle and dogs. “They cleaned it a few days ago, around the time elections were announced. But now it is the same again. Animals gather around these dumping zones and are a risk for children,\" said area resident Sangeeta Tomar. The same issues are faced in sectors 18, 19, 13, and 9 too. However, in some parts, the situation has improved in the last few weeks, particularly as the city administration gets ready for assembly polls in February. But many residents said the problems will return soon. While garbage on vacant plots and roadsides bothers a majority of the people in the city, most residents living in the housing societies of Rohini say that they are happy with the parks and the open-air gyms installed in these. However, some parks News18 visited were also used for drying clothes and as dumping zones. Yet a majority of the parks were well maintained and had locals enjoying the winter sun. Scenes from Rohini.

The voters here, more or less, seemed satisfied with the MLA and didn’t blame him for the situation. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi is the body responsible for dealing with garbage. Illegal parking on roads, roadsides, and in market areas is another major issue in several sectors of the Rohini assembly constituency. “People park irresponsibly, and there is no check from the authorities. Sometimes, I also feel there are not enough spaces for cars in the area, but there should be a way out of this situation,\" said 25-year-old Gargi Chaddha, a resident of sector 18. She also highlighted the lack of public toilets in the locality. “Firstly, it is impossible to find a public toilet in the area, and if you manage to find one, it would not be in a condition to use,\" she added. Crime rate and law and order have also left the people worried. Chain and mobile phone snatching is a very common issue, according to several women who spoke with News18. Prashant Vihar seems to be one of the worst-impacted areas. Last month, the body of a 38-year-old man was found in a park in Prashant Vihar. In November and October 2024, two blasts were reported in the area – one outside a CRPF school and another near PVR Cinema.

Vijender Gupta, who was elected from the seat in 2015 and 2020, is now aiming for a third term. The popularity of Gupta and the BJP could be understood from the fact that there were lanes in the assembly that were full of the party’s flags.

(Representational photo/PTI) After close to three decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party smells an opportunity in the national capital, which will have elections early next month. The saffron party is putting together all its efforts to unseat the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi. With the motto of ending “aapda\" (crisis) rule in the capital, the saffron party has adopted an all-hands-on-deck approach. Not only are campaigns being carried out by BJP candidates and leaders, especially from Delhi, but the party has a more deep-rooted strategy. related stories Sources say that a team of 27 leaders has been constituted, which will be supervised by union home minister Amit Shah. Given his political acumen and proven track record as an organisation person, the saffron party is hopeful that this team will deliver the goods. This team, which consists of union ministers, party office-bearers, and members of Parliament, has been given a very specific assignment. The 27 include union ministers like Mansukh Mandaviya, Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, and Bhupender Yadav. BJP general secretaries Vinod Tawde and Sunil Bansal are also in it. Several MPs, including Vivek Thakur, Surendra Nagar, Arvind Dharmapuri, Biplab Deb, etc, are part of this panel. This team had a special meeting with Amit Shah a couple of days ago, and the brainstorming went on for more than four hours. The saffron party is extremely confident that its strategy of strengthening the booths will make all the difference in the upcoming elections . “We will be focusing on every booth across the capital. Since we have been able to win all the seats in Delhi in the Lok Sabha polls three times, a detailed study will be done on why the party is not able to convert the results of these booths in the assembly elections,\" a source aware of the developments told CNN-News18. Each of these leaders has been assigned two assembly constituencies where they will work over and above the task that has been handed to party leaders, star campaigners, and candidates themselves. “The job will be to ensure that the gap in the voters who voted for the BJP is closed in favour of the saffron party. There is no need for us to start campaigning aggressively or start delivering lectures or speeches. We will purely be doing much-needed work behind the scenes in each constituency,\" another source told CNN-News18. “Delhi is a confluence of many regions and cultures, and therefore, with the kind of bandwidth that the BJP has, we can bring in leaders from all parts of the country to come in for the management of elections. This is going to be extremely important since this will be an election for the BJP to win and AAP to lose.\" There are multiple things that a party or a candidate needs to focus on during elections, which takes away a lot of time from the contestant and the supporting personnel around him. This task will be outsourced to the 27 BJP members who will be in charge of the polls. “Realistically speaking, there are 51 seats that the party has identified that are viable and where there is a close contest between the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party or the Congress and BJP. Therefore, if the BJP is able to win these 51 seats, then the battle is pretty much over for the opposition,\" a source said. With less than two weeks to go for the high-profile elections in the national capital, this team of 27 will act as backroom boys to aid the candidates and the party in these constituencies. “The biggest advantage of having political leaders do the back-end work in a man-to-man marking situation remains that a political leader can be quick enough to find a political solution to an issue and can communicate effectively not just to the party leaders but also to the public concerned,\" a source said. This team of 27 will report to Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda directly on every issue of concern and also give them updates on the campaign, the way it is progressing on the ground, and whether the message that the saffron party is trying to send through its initiatives, announcements in the manifesto, and the concerns of the public reaches where they need to.

There is also a message in the song for the people of the national capital to pave the way for a better Delhi by rejecting the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the coming Assembly elections, he said. “The inspiration for the song came from the word AAP-da (disaster) used by Modi ji for the ruling AAP for its failure and mess created in Delhi under its ten-year rule in BJP’s Parivartan Rally recently held in Rohini,\" Bakshi added.

(PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi, adopting a strategy of speaking on local issues with BJP workers regarding the Delhi election campaign, said people in the national capital are angry with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is getting nervous as polls near. PM Modi’s 80-minute-long message underlined the BJP’s strategy to expose the AAP on local issues of Delhi. He has given two big tasks to BJP’s workers — ensuring the highest turnout in their booth in the last decade, and achieving 50%-plus vote share for the BJP in every booth of Delhi. He said BJP’s workers must “expose the lies of AAP-Da\". related stories “Delhi’s people are sick of AAP’s lies, they have duped the people. They do new announcements daily because they hear news of defeat from various areas daily. People of Delhi have seen through AAP’s nervousness. AAP says ‘Phir Aayenge’ and people in the crowd say “Yeh Phir Khayenge (they will do more corruption),\" the prime minister said. The PM has also kept up his attack on AAP on the major issue of corruption, saying the focus of Arvind Kejriwal’s party was only on one thing – “Sheeshmahal Banao\". He said every Delhi resident remembers the lies of AAP when he or she sees Sheeshmahal. “It is a living symbol of corruption. Money was spent like water on Sheeshmahal,\" the prime minister said, alluding to a C&AG report. Modi said the people of AAP have no shame despite the Sheeshmahal and liquor scams. “No Delhi resident likes this and they are angry with AAP,\" the PM said. The prime minister said social activist Anna Hazare was also upset with Kejriwal as he established a party on the issue of Jan Lokpal, which does not exist in Delhi or Punjab where AAP has governments. “AAP showed CAG reports to expose the Congress’s corruption. Today, CAG reports exist but AAP is hiding them for the last four years as they are afraid of the truth and people knowing about their sins. We will table the CAG reports in assembly as soon as we come to power,\" he said. Modi added that Delhi should have an identity as national capital just like Bengaluru, Gurgaon, or Noida has. “AAP just blames others and does not do any work. We need double-engine government in Delhi,\" he said. Focus on Local Issues The PM said water and tanker mafia is operating in Delhi and people are forced to drink dirty water. He said AAP “hates people of Purvanchal as they made migrants leave Delhi during the Covid-19 pandemic\". The PM also said AAP does not want to adopt the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi “out of ego\" as they don’t care for the people of Delhi. He said BJP will give safe drinking water to people in Delhi through a mega campaign, like in other states. “Sharab toh milti hai, paani nahi milta hai,\" the prime minister said, referring to the condition of Delhi. He said AAP should have improved roads, sewers, build parks and parking spaces – but they did not fulfill any responsibility. He said AAP should also be exposed on the electricity bill issue as people’s bills have increased. The PM said BJP will clean the Yamuna like it had done with the Sabarmati riverfront and at the Kumbh. “AAP earlier said if they don’t clean Yamuna, then people should not vote for them. Show those videos.\" He said videos of AAP leaders’ earlier statements must be shown to people to expose their lies with proof. “We will improve Delhi’s government schools in the true sense with free education from KG to PG,\" the PM said. He said AAP promised to build houses, but did nothing. “But we have pictures of the houses built by BJP in Delhi, show them to the people,\" the PM said. BJP’s Promises The PM said the BJP’s promise of Rs 2,500 for women in Delhi will be fulfilled after the win in the national capital. “We are giving money under women’s scheme in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and other states. We fulfill our promises,\" he said. The prime minister said AAP is copying the Congress in making promises in Delhi but they have a government in Punjab where they fulfilled no promises like the Rs 1,000 per month to women. “People in Delhi don’t trust AAP’s promises, they have seen what happened in Himachal. AAP is two steps ahead of Congress, they have all the bad qualities of the Congress party. This is AAP-Da model which makes promises in the air. Women are my biggest suraksha-kavach,\" the prime minister said. He also referred to the Centre’s decision on the 8th Pay Commission and said there are lakhs of families in Delhi who serve in the government sector or get pension. “Their futu...",

(File pic/AFP) The Congress is gearing up for the big fight in Delhi. A tad late, many would argue, but with Arvind Kejriwal not letting go of his attacks on the Congress, the grand old party has made up its mind to take them on. Sources say that at a meeting, Rahul Gandhi argued that there was no point in pushing coalition dharma if it came at the cost of the Congress’s “astitva\" (existence). The Congress alone was capable of taking on the Bharatiya Janata Party at the national level, and if it weakens and gives up on fights, then its stand weakens. Rahul Gandhi said that the Congress cannot be the alternative to the BJP or protect the Constitution if it loses its presence in states. related stories The Congress has been weakened or wiped out in many states like West Bengal, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh when it allowed other players or regional parties to grow at its cost. For example, in Delhi and Punjab, it’s the Aam Aadmi Party that has grown at the cost of the Congress. Their vote bank is the same, and many in the party, like Ajay Maken, feel that Congress should not have gone soft on Kejriwal even though he was part of the INDIA bloc. Many gave feedback that despite a public snubbing of Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury by Mallikarjun Kharge during the Bengal Lok Sabha polls to assuage Mamata Banerjee, she has not been soft on the Congress. In fact, the Trinamool Congress has led this call to make Mamata the face of the India bloc, citing the Congress’s poor poll performance as the reason why Congress cannot be the force to take on the Modi factor. This, along with the fact that many allies like the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, and TMC supported AAP in Delhi over the Congress, has made the Gandhis feel that other bloc members have not followed the coalition dharma, so why should the Congress alone be expected to follow suit? So, to adhere to its plan to make its presence felt in Delhi, a couple of steps will be taken. Like Ajay Maken, who was stopped from doing a tell-all exposé on Kejriwal earlier, will now do one. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will hit the streets. Rahul is expected to hold some meetings in Muslim-dominated areas and places where Dalits and OBCs are an important vote bank. Priyanka too is expected to campaign to capture women’s votes. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all But will the belated fight by the Congress help the BJP or hurt Kejriwal? The Congress, by its own admission, doesn’t seem confident of winning seats but hopes to increase its vote percentage in Delhi, where it has zero MPs and MLAs. For the Congress, this would be a start. As a senior Congress leader told News18, “Even if the BJP wins this time, next time we can. But more than this, defeat of AAP would mean Delhi will have only two players—Congress and BJP—and we will be back in the game.\" The Congress also hopes now that the loss of AAP in Delhi will make it easy for the party in Punjab as well. Hence the need to make the “dangal\" for Delhi a three-cornered fight. tags : aap congress delhi assembly election delhi election delhi elections Rahul Gandhi Location : New Delhi, India First Published: January 22, 2025, 06:00 IST News elections Congress Makes Late Push In Delhi Dangal; Here's Why Read More",

(Image: PTI/File) Sunita Kejriwal was there alongside her husband, Arvind Kejriwal, in the 2020 assembly elections in Delhi, seeking votes for him but she was not part of the AAP’s official election campaign until recently. Only after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal went to jail in March last year, Sunita Kejriwal started getting space as one of the party’s star campaigners. She was there for the Lok Sabha, Jammu and Kashmir , as well as Haryana polls. related stories The AAP, however, was unable to create magic in any of these elections, except gaining entry into the J&K assembly with a single victory in Doda. Now, when the list of star campaigners for Delhi was announced, Sunita found a mention yet again. She is not a mass leader or a great orator but kept a low profile all these years while her husband was making headlines. She appeared in public only when necessary. But, Sunita’s appearance as Kejriwal’s wife has always helped him. Be it when he went for a sit-in at the Delhi L-G’s house in 2018 or when he went to jail in March last year. She has always managed to gather emotional support for her husband. She has been spotted walking behind or beside Kejriwal on important occasions, but only marked a mute presence without making noise. Even when there were murmurs about finding Kejriwal’s replacement for the post of chief minister, the BJP was expecting her name to be announced but she stayed away. Sunita has mostly made her public statements when Kejriwal has been absent – once in 2018 when Kejriwal stayed at the L-G’s official residence to protest against the officials working in Delhi. And, then in March 2024, after he went to jail, she would deliver his letters addressed to the people of Delhi.

Written By : Aman Sharma News18.com Last Updated: January 20, 2025, 08:30 IST The women’s allowance scheme to be rolled out in Delhi, by whichever party wins these elections, will nearly double the city’s subsidy bill to Rs 22,000 crore every year reset Follow us on Google News The next 15 days will see people, and especially women, weigh the promises of AAP, BJP, and Congress and vote accordingly on February 5. (Representational image: News18) With 15 days to go before votes are cast, the Delhi elections have started a war of freebies. The Aam Aadmi Party, the BJP, and the Congress are going all out to woo the voters with financial benefits and subsidies. The Aam Aadmi Party is giving 200 units of free electricity and 20,000 litres of free water a month to domestic consumers, free bus rides for women, and has promised Rs 2,100 a month for women if it is in power again. It has also promised free electricity and water for those staying on rent. related stories The Congress has promised Rs 2,500 a month for women and 300 units of free power, but it is a small player in the Delhi polls. The big counter in fact has come from the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has promised Rs 2,500 to women every month and gas cylinders at Rs 500. The party is also expected to announce certain units of free power and free water. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that no existing public welfare scheme in Delhi will be stopped. Freebies have determined the outcome of the Delhi elections in a big way, both in 2015 and 2020, when AAP won with massive mandates on the back of its sops. But this time, the BJP is posing a strong challenge with counter-freebies. The big question is, who will the people of Delhi believe in now? We will come to that just in a bit. First, let us look at the burden of the freebies on the exchequer. An estimated Rs 11,000 crore is spent on subsidies in Delhi every year, like free electricity, free water, and free bus rides for women. The women’s allowance scheme to be rolled out in Delhi, by whichever party wins these elections, will nearly double the city’s subsidy bill to Rs 22,000 crore every year. Delhi has for long not been a revenue-deficit state but is poised to become one given the rising freebie bill. But Delhi is not the only region that is getting weighed down under the rising bill of monthly payouts to women, which is becoming a standard poll promise across India. Let’s talk about some history. It all started in West Bengal in 2021, when Mamata Banerjee first brought the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme for women. Presently, Rs 1,000-Rs 1,200 per month is given to women under it. The scheme has had a deep impact on the Trinamool Congress’s poll successes in West Bengal. The Congress took a leaf out of Mamata Banerjee’s book to promise Rs 1,500 per month for women during the 2022 Himachal Pradesh elections and won the state. In 2023, the BJP jumped onto the bandwagon with the then chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, rolling out the Ladli Behna Yojana, under which Rs 1,250 per month is given to women. This scheme was seen as a major reason for the BJP’s thumping win in Madhya Pradesh. In the same year, the Gruha Lakshmi scheme was launched by the Congress government in Karnataka with a monthly assistance of Rs 2,000 for women, again a promise that brought it to power in the elections. 2024 saw a flurry of states launch similar schemes. Chhattisgarh rolled out the Mahtari Vandana Yojana with Rs 1,000 per month for women after a poll promise by the BJP that gave it a win. The Congress promised the Maha Lakshmi Scheme with Rs 2,500 a month for women in the Telangana elections and won the state. The JMM government in Jharkhand started the Maiya Samman Yojana in 2024 before the elections, offering Rs 1,000 monthly assistance to women, and was victorious. Finally, the BJP in Maharashtra rolled out its women scheme at Rs 1,500 per month and won the recent elections with a huge majority. So all parties have realised the winning mantra—a monetary scheme for women, as they are a major vote bank. Now, the big question: whose promises will work in Delhi? In past elections, what has been seen is that the first-mover advantage is key when it comes to offering women’s schemes. Whichever party can give the money first gets the pole position, compared to the party promising it. That means the incumbent party invariably has an advantage. We have seen this both in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, where the BJP government sent some instalments of the money to the bank accounts of women before elections and won the polls as women trusted that party more whose government was already giving the money. In rural areas of the country where women have invariably been dependent on the men in the family for money to run the household, the money coming directly into their bank accounts is a major empowering tool that gives them...",

They are greatly affected when they don’t receive government subsidies.\" He also said the scheme would be greatly beneficial for “our Purvanchali brothers\". Kejriwal’s latest outreach can be seen as an effort to gain Purvanchali votes, which became the latest flashpoint in the tussle between the AAP and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the latter accused Kejriwal of insulting the community.

(AP file for representation) The national capital is gearing up for electing its eighth assembly next month. In the past three decades, while the participation of women in elections has improved significantly, their representation in the assembly remains little more than mere lip service. related stories In the three elections held between 1998 and 2008, the women voter turnout was 56% or less, but in the past three elections – 2013, 2015 and 2020 – the turnout has improved significantly and surpassed the 60% mark. The voter turnout is the average number of voters who step out to vote on the polling day. A turnout of 60% means that out of every 100 voters, 60 came to the polling booths on the day of polling. The more voters at the polling booths, the higher the turnout. Women’s share in total voters in the city and their participation has significantly improved, but the total number of women elected to the house remains in single digits. There are three main political parties in Delhi – the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress. These parties have supported the women’s reservation bill in Parliament in 2023. But for 33% reservation, at least 23 women have to be elected to the house in one term. On the contrary, since 1993, only 39 women have been elected to the house collectively in seven elections. ELECTED WOMEN LEGISLATORS Never in the history of the Delhi assembly has the total number of elected women in an assembly touched double digits. It was the 1998 assembly poll, when nine women were elected to the house – the highest so far. A total of 491 women contested the Delhi assembly elections since 1993, but almost 80% of these women, 391, lost deposits. The importance of women in Delhi elections is clearly visible with the way political parties are trying to attract women voters in Delhi. Both the AAP and Congress have promised a monthly monetary scheme for women, if elected. The BJP has also announced a similar scheme, like it is running in other states. Little before the 2020 elections, the AAP had launched a free bus ride scheme for all women. Since the 2013 elections, voter participation in Delhi has improved significantly. Although the election of 2020 saw less voter participation than 2015, it has been above 60%. Further, the gender gap between voter turnout has also dropped significantly over the years. In 2020, the average women voter turnout was 62.51% against men’s 62.59%. The gap was widest in 1993 when male turnout was 64.56%, but female was 58.27%.

In fact, things went so bad that the BJP had to release a third list consisting of a single name after the said candidate – Mohan Singh Bisht – openly rebelled against the party leadership. From shouting slogans to accusing BJP leaders of being unaware of the ground situation, dissent overflowed, costing embarrassment to the party that takes pride in keeping its cadres disciplined. related stories PROTESTS OVER TUGHLAKABAD, KARAWAL NAGAR CANDIDATES One of the main seats where dissent was noticed was Tughlakabad — a seat Ramesh Bidhuri represented for three terms as MLA since 2008. BJP’s second list was released on Saturday. In this, the names of 29 candidates were announced. In this list, Rohtas Bidhuri has been fielded from the Tughlakabad seat. However, in the 2020 assembly elections, Vikram Bidhuri — Ramesh Bidhuri’s relative — contested this seat and he lost to Sahiram of Aam Aadmi Party by more than 13,000 votes, which is the reason he is not being given a ticket this time from Tughlakabad. But that did not stop his supporters from agitating. Protestors from Tughlakabad in South Delhi reached the Delhi BJP office and staged a protest at the gate. The protesting workers demanded a change of candidate for this seat. The matter did not stop at that. In highly dramatised optics that were bound to serve the AAP, angry protesters also raised slogans of “ Modi tujhse bair nahi, Rohtas teri khair nahi (We have no discontent with you, Modi, but, Rohtas, you won’t be spared)\". Afraid of an inside hit job at Rohtas Bidhuri, the current BJP candidate from Tughlakabad, the BJP tried not to take the disciplinary route and instead reached out to them saying, the party will ensure Rohtas will take everyone along once he wins, said sources. But this did not stop at pro-Vikram Bidhuri slogans. The BJP fielded former AAP minister Kapil Mishra from Karawal Nagar, disregarding the five-time MLA Bisht, forcing Bisht to turn rebel. Bisht — an Uttarakhandi and Rajput face – played the victim card. He openly criticised the BJP leadership and called fielding Mishra, whom he called “aire gaire natthu khaire\", a “big mistake\". “The BJP thinks they will field anyone and he will win. This is a big mistake. Only time will tell what will happen in Burari, Karawal Nagar, Ghonda, Seelampur, Gokalpuri, and Nand Nagri seats,\" he threatened, forcing the BJP to open an overnight communication channel with him to assure Bisht that a third list bearing only his name would be put out. This is exactly what happened as BJP’s third list, bearing only his name, was released announcing he would be contesting from Mustafabad. MEHRAULI, MADIPUR & MORE This is not the first time dissent oozed out during the run-up to Delhi election. After the list of candidates was released, the Delhi BJP office witnessed protests like those the party office witnessed by the pro-Vikram Bidhuri faction.

(News18/PTI File) The unreleased reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) will be the ‘kaal’ (doom) for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal, just like it shook the Congress-led UPA-II and brought down the two-term government of the late Dr Manmohan Singh, said Vijender Gupta, Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) leader of opposition in the Delhi assembly. Speaking to News18, the two-time Rohini MLA also said that the AAP is suppressing the CAG reports as they are aware that it contains blunders, corruption, leakages and misuse of public funds. related stories “The leaked report has hints of all these things. In the past five years, not a single CAG report has been tabled in the assembly. These reports contain reality on pollution, health and education. These reports are the audit of public money that shows blunders. They are holding up these reports as they know otherwise their reality would be made public through these reports. This is complete lawlessness,\" Gupta said ahead of filing his nominations on Wednesday. He went on to say that the reports from CAG authenticate the corruption of Kejriwal and his party under their rule. “The CAG reports brought down the government of the late Manmohan Singh. All those scams, including 2G, came out in public due to the reports from CAG. These reports (on Delhi) will be the ‘kaal’ of Kejriwal too,\" he said in Hindi. THE CAG REPORTS The CAG is the supreme audit institution of India. The body is empowered to audit all receipts and expenditure of the Union and State Governments and various bodies under them. The audit reports from CAG come into the public domain after they are tabled in the Parliament or the concerned state legislature. However, the CAG reports on the Delhi government were leaked before it was tabled. The leaked reports show some irregularities. The BJP MLAs, including Gupta, have been demanding the tabling of these reports for a long time now and eventually moved court for the same. On Monday, the Delhi High Court questioned the Delhi government over the delay in the tabling of these reports saying it “raises doubts about your bona fides\". The next hearing in this case is on January 16. Gupta went on to say that they did everything in their hands to table these reports in the assembly but the AAP blocked them everywhere. “We were marshalled out of the assembly for demanding the tabling of these reports. They don’t want to bring these reports to the assembly because they are hiding the truth. Now our only hope is court. We are hopeful that the court will give directions to table these reports,\" he said. The outgoing LoP explained that a session should be called before the elections are held. “The house is still live and can be called even now. The house should be called and these reports should be tabled and made public. This has nothing to do with elections,\" he said. Another case was filed in the Delhi High Court saying that at least 14 CAG reports are pending and should be tabled before elections are held on February 5. On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court asked the CAG to explain why the reports could not be made public. The next hearing will be held on January 24. WHAT SANJAY SINGH HAD SAID Earlier this month, when parts of the CAG reports were leaked, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said the BJP was using forged documents to push its narrative. “The CAG report comes in a sealed cover and has not yet been tabled. Meanwhile, the BJP is using forged documents to push its narrative,\" he had said, raising counter questions for the BJP governments in several states not publishing these reports. जय श्री राम।श्री मनोहर लाल खट्टर जी और रोहिणी की जनता के आशीर्वाद के साथ, नामांकन दाखिल हेतु प्रस्थान। pic.twitter.com/gl3sl1c1Dk — Vijender Gupta (@Gupta_vijender) January 15, 2025 POLL PROSPECTS Gupta, who filed his nomination from the Rohini assembly seat aiming for a third term, went on to say that they will form the government with a complete majority. “People had enough of them (AAP). They are exposed now. The narrative they gave on honesty had been broken. This was their USP (unique selling proposition) but now people are not trusting them. We are forming the government with a complete majority,\" he added. Gupta went on to say that in the past 10 years, the AAP destroyed the city.

Legally too, it might be difficult for Kejriwal to return as chief minister. (PTI) Just ahead of Delhi elections, the Centre has thrown yet another curveball at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) after Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials claimed that the Ministry of Home Affairs had given the sanction to prosecute both Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia in the excise policy money laundering case. The development comes even as Kejriwal announced that he would file his nomination papers from the New Delhi Vidhan Sabha seat on Wednesday. Why is the prosecution sanction important? related stories The missing prosecution sanction had been cited by the AAP supremo to challenge the PMLA court’s decision to take cognizance of the charge sheet against Kejriwal, Sisodia, and others. But now, with the legality being completed, the stage could be set for framing of charges against the accused in the excise policy scam.

We have also received the sanction against Manish Sisodia,\" an ED official confirmed. While the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had received sanction to prosecute Kejriwal under Prevention of Corruption Act, ED moved for a separate sanction under Section 197(1) of CRPC as mandated by a Supreme Court order. How will this impact polls? The special court could take up the matter on January 30, just five days ahead of polls in Delhi. ED is likely to push for framing of charges after presenting the requisite documents. Once the charges are framed, the trial against Kejriwal and Sisodia will begin. Kejriwal was granted bail by the Supreme Court in September last year. Sisodia had been granted bail a month earlier and delayed trial was one of the grounds the apex court considered before giving relief. Now, if trial begins, the BJP will up the ante against AAP in the last leg of campaigning. Legally too, it might be difficult for Kejriwal to return as chief minister while the trial is on. His bail conditions had forced him to step down from the CM’s chair since he was barred from visiting the secretariat or CMO. He was also restricted from signing any files. A delayed trial could have given AAP a window to request for change in bail conditions had the party secured a mandate in February 2025.

But, missing in his speech were references to the ‘Sheesh Mahal’ row and the CAG report on the now-scrapped liquor policy. As he launched his poll campaign, his attack was more focused on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the RSS. He accused the BJP-led central government of compromising the Constitution and also blamed it for running a monopoly of the corporates. related stories Nothing new here, but just that, for the Delhi elections, when most of the Congress leaders were sharing stage with him, they were, perhaps, hoping more of an attack against the AAP. Present among other party leaders were also those who are contesting the polls, including Sandeep Dikshit, who is up against Kejriwal. Delhi Congress leaders were caught by surprise, having prepared themselves for an aggressive battle against Kejriwal and reclaim what was once a strong ground for them. They were assured by the top leadership that Gandhi and the party will come on strong. Calling his first rally the ‘Jai Bhim, Samvidhan Bachao’ rally, Gandhi’s indication was clear – that his speech will focus more on the BJP and RSS and little on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). His speech came on a day when the high court rapped the Delhi government for “dragging its feet\" over calling an assembly session to table the CAG report on the excise policy. ALSO READ | AAP Will Face Voter Backlash In Delhi For Suppressing CAG Reports, Says Hardeep Singh Puri In a conversation with News18 , Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri raised questions on what the AAP government has to hide, seeing as they were not allowing an assembly session to be called. Gandhi’s silence on the ‘Sheesh Mahal’ controversy and the CAG reports left his party disappointed. All the more because it was first a complaint by the Congress that shone a light on the alleged liquor policy scam. In fact, the BJP is hopeful that the Congress will gear up because that will help them politically and divide the “anti-BJP camp\" again. “The congress must understand that if it fails to fight the AAP, it will meet the same fate as it did in Maharashtra and many other states,\" Puri said. The Gandhis, however, believe that keeping the BJP away is more important even if it means that Kejriwal gets another term in Delhi at the cost of the Congress. It was clear from Rahul’s Seelampur rally that for him the  bigger enemy is the RSS and BJP. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all He rounded up his speech by saying he will keep attacking the RSS and BJP till his last breath. But, on some occasions, he did mention that like the BJP and the Prime Minister, Kejriwal, too, had failed to fulfil his promise to the people of the city.

In wake of other INDIA bloc allies rallying around the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Congress campaign for the Delhi elections has, so far, been low-key but intriguing. After a number of flip-flops, many have wondered where the Gandhi family members are. related stories Rahul Gandhi was out of the country when the poll dates were announced, and even when the Congress unveiled the ‘five guarantees’ – conducted by party leader Sachin Pilot and Delhi unit leaders. It is, however, quite clear that the Congress has decided to pipe down its campaign against the AAP . It is caught in a dilemma, where the Delhi unit wants the top leadership to attack the AAP as a political revival due to which the party was initially critical of the Arvind Kejriwal-led party. So much so that senior leader Ajay Maken was waiting for the mourning period for former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh to end, to make “big revelations\" about the AAP. After all, he was the communications incharge when the Anna Hazare movement was launched and was privy to much behind the scenes. But, this press conference never happened.

That may act as a cue for the rest of the party, but, for now, it seems to have chosen coalition dharma over party astitva .

After the Sheesh Mahal issue, the BJP’s arsenal against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the Delhi election campaign on the issue of corruption has got another boost with a C&AG report pegging the loss caused by the Delhi liquor scam at Rs 2,026 crore. The BJP is making corruption and the lack of probity in public life the centerpiece of its poll campaign this time, sensing the AAP is on a weak ground on the same. related stories This makes the 2025 Delhi election very different from the 2020 or the 2015 elections in the national capital. Then, AAP had cashed in on its image of being a ‘Kattar Imaandaar’ (honest) party and its leader Arvind Kejriwal working on the principle of ‘simple living and high thinking’. The liquor scam and Sheesh Mahal controversy is questioning both these USPs of AAP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also said to have asked BJP leaders to ‘expose’ AAP and Kejriwal on the issue of corruption in Delhi and make more efforts in this regard. BJP leader Anurag Thakur has said there would be no other party whose eight ministers, various MLAs, and the then chief minister and deputy chief minister had to go to jail. In many ways, the BJP is trying to repeat in the Delhi assembly elections against AAP what it successfully did against the Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections — that the incumbent government is rocked by corruption scams and people should vote on this issue. This strategy also is to take the focus away from AAP’s freebies that have worked for Kejriwal’s party in the last two elections. The prime minister has assured Delhi’s voters that no existing schemes running in public interest will be stopped if BJP comes to power. Top BJP leaders feel the sheen of Kejriwal is gone this time, with serious charges of corruption and scams against him, due to which Kejriwal and senior AAP leaders like Manish Sisodia had to go to jail. To double down on this issue, the party first raised the ‘Sheesh Mahal’ issue, pointing to a C&AG report that pegged the renovation cost of the chief minister’s residence at Rs 33.6 crore. Now, the new revelations about the monetary loss caused by the liquor scam are giving the BJP more ammunition against AAP. Remember, this is the same case in which top AAP leaders were jailed. While Kejriwal and Sisodia always claimed that not even a single penny was recovered regarding the alleged scam, the C&AG report is — for the first time — putting a figure to the said scam at Rs 2,026 crore. One can expect top BJP leaders led by PM Modi to raise this ‘loss figure of Rs 2026 crore’ strongly during the Delhi election campaign that begins in full flow this week. BJP president JP Nadda has termed this the ‘AAP-DA’ [catastrophe] model of loot in full display and claimed that it is just a matter of a few weeks before AAP is voted out and punished for their misdeeds. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The Aam Aadmi Party’s strategy seems to be terming the C&AG reports as a BJP ploy during elections and the party is playing them down, claiming their top leaders were jailed under false charges. The bail granted to Kejriwal or Sisodia were celebrated by the AAP as big victories. But the BJP here is trying to tell the voters that coming out on bail does not mean any clean chit and the court trial will go on. It is reminding voters that both C&AG reports, into Sheesh Mahal and the liquor scam, are proof that AAP leaders are not above board. tags : Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) AAP vs BJP delhi elections Location : New Delhi, India First Published: January 12, 2025, 09:26 IST News elections First Sheesh Mahal, Now Rs 2,026 Crore Liquor Scam Loss: BJP Banks On ‘Corruption’ Plank in Delhi Elections Read More",

(PTI) In the aftermath of the Maharashtra assembly elections, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) faction has shifted its focus to the crucial Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections . While the assembly results saw the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, which includes Sena UBT, Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar) and Congress, suffer a major defeat, Thackeray is determined to leave the past behind and reclaim the Sena’s stronghold in Mumbai. related stories A growing sentiment among party leaders and grassroots workers is that the Shiv Sena UBT should contest the BMC elections independently, breaking away from the MVA, particularly the Congress, to preserve its identity and assert its strength. Over the past month, Thackeray has been conducting detailed reviews of the party’s organisational structure across Mumbai. He has held multiple meetings with branch heads, sub-divisional leaders, and assembly organisers to assess the party’s readiness. Feedback collected by party observers, who were deployed to monitor the city’s constituencies, highlights a clear demand for contesting the elections on the party’s own terms. Many believe the friction between the Congress and Sena UBT during the assembly polls over seat-sharing left a sour taste, prompting workers to advocate for a standalone approach. Thackeray’s rigorous reviews include a ward-wise analysis of voter sentiments and the party’s strength. Meetings held at Matoshree have revealed a strong push from local leaders to fight independently. They argue that an alliance risks diluting the Sena’s core identity, which has been synonymous with Mumbai’s political landscape for decades. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Despite this growing consensus, the final decision lies with Thackeray, who is carefully weighing all options.

(PTI) The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) manifesto committee is brainstorming over what promises to make to the people of Delhi. The party has an explosive CAG report that demolishes Arvind Kejriwal’s “aam aadmi\" image over alleged splurging over his residence, which they have dubbed as “Sheesh Mahal\" . The BJP’s biggest vote-catcher, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also launched a scathing attack on the ruling AAP calling it “AAP-da\" or calamity. related stories The BJP has all it takes to win the Delhi elections on February 5, along with the fact the AAP has been in power for a really long time, which should go against it. Yet, questions remain. There’s a reason behind it. PM MODI, AAP-DA, SHEESH MAHAL: THE PERFECT MIX The manifesto committee has been flirting with the idea of announcing a woman’s scheme giving them Rs 2,500 each month — an amount the Congress has promised. However, sources in the BJP say many want the leadership to cross the Rs 2,500-mark and have an edge over both the Congress and AAP. However, the decision is pending, they say. News18 has learnt that the BJP may announce free electricity of up to 300 units and free piped water to Delhi residents in its ‘Sankalp Patra’ which will be released soon. Taking a leaf out of AAP’s book, the BJP is learnt to be planning to provide free electricity of up to 500 units to religious places such as temples and gurdwaras. The BJP has meticulously used the leaked CAG report to hit where it hurts the most — Kejriwal’s brand image which took years to build. An image of a commoner, who is from the working class, joined politics to change the polity of the country has been ruthlessly demolished by the BJP through consecutive press conferences and posting of videos, so much so that ‘Sheesh Mahal’ started to trend on X. PM Modi led the attack, “You will be pained to know that when people were fighting Covid, running around to get medicines and oxygen, their (AAP’s) entire focus was on making Sheesh Mahal.\" The alleged corruption of the AAP leaders is now an election issue with the PM calling the party top brass “kattar beiman\". The AAP has been in power in Delhi since 2013, with a break. The anti-incumbency and unrealised promises such as tap water and clean Yamuna should be easy for the BJP to exploit. Also, what should help the BJP more is campaigning by PM Narendra Modi — a vote-catcher, a man who India listens to. He recently said, “Jabse maine aapda ka kaccha chittha khola hai, tabse ye aapda wale tilmila gaye hain ye log (since I started exposing these people, they have been in a panic).\" All in all, come February 8, the BJP has enough reason to be confident. But it’s easier said than done. WHY BJP CAN’T BE FULLY CONFIDENT The last time the BJP had a CM face in Delhi was 2015, when they brought Kiran Bedi. The BJP faced defeat, and Bedi, too, lost from Krishna Nagar. Ever since the party stopped experimenting with the CM face and has resorted to Narendra Modi’s face — a trend emulated in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh elections not so long ago. But Arvind Kejriwal, regardless of what the BJP might think, has nearly served a decade as the Chief Minister and that registers well with the voters. In the 2020 polls, the BJP’s vote share was 38.51 per cent, while that of the AAP was 53.57 per cent. The massive gap of 15 per cent meant the BJP won just eight seats out of 70, ensuring an AAP sweep with 62 seats. Bridging this gap will not just be a tough call for the BJP, but for any political opponent. Despite the BJP’s mega outreach programme to AAP’s two core voter bases — auto drivers and slum dwellers — insiders say they continue to prefer the AAP. Initially, the idea was to swing 30-40 per cent of Delhi’s 93,000 auto drivers towards the BJP to help increase its vote share. But now, insiders say, that doesn’t seem to be happening. Similarly, PM Modi may have tried to reach out by handing out 1,645 flats to poor slum dwellers, but that mood does not seem to reflect in other slums where there have been no beneficiaries. “What makes our job tough is the cosmopolitan nature of Delhi and the unique way they vote. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, these very voters en masse voted for the BJP, giving us seven out of seven MPs. Then came the 2020 assembly elections and they voted for the AAP. It’s not about slums or posh areas — Delhi voters are transactional. So we have to sell a different BJP for the Lok Sabha polls and another for assembly, both customised to their needs,\" a B...",

The warm smiles have given way to the perpetual chill of a marriage gone sour. But, those who have been watching the banding together of these unlikely opposition parties are not as surprised.

But, the most ominous sign comes from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), where Tejashwi Yadav has said the opposition front was only for the general elections.

(X) While Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will provide free treatment to senior citizens in the national capital even in private hospitals if it is re-elected, the ultimate aim is to cover each individual from birth under a similar setup, Satyendar Jain, former health minister and the creator of mohalla clinics, told News18. The leader said the party and the government will not consider itself successful until quality education and healthcare are provided to all. In case of education, Jain said the aim is to bring at least 80% students in Delhi to public schools. related stories Jain shared that so far at least three lakh students in Delhi have moved to government schools from private schools as the quality of education has improved. This number, he assured, will go up further if the AAP is re-elected in 2025. “We want to give every citizen of Delhi quality education and quality healthcare… You will see how a big share of students will move from private to public schools in the near future. We want all students in Delhi, or at least 80 per cent of them, to study in government schools. Similar wish is for healthcare,\" he said. Jain said maximum people in Delhi should use government healthcare and until the AAP and its government achieve this, they will not consider themselves successful. Delhi will go to polls on February 5 and the results will be announced on February 8. ‘WHY NO FREE HEALTHCARE FOR THOSE ABOVE POVERTY LINE?’ Speaking about the AAP’s poll promise of free healthcare for elders above the age of 60, Jain said this will eventually cover each and every citizen without any eligibility or class division. “Be it Rs 1 lakh or Rs 1 crore, the treatment in public and private hospitals will be free for senior citizens. This is the first stage. We will consider ourselves successful only if we provide this scheme to each and every individual without any economic or class divide,\" he assured, adding, “It will eventually cover 100 per cent population in Delhi.\" Slamming the political parties and past governments in India, he said they have drawn a line called the poverty line. “All schemes are for those below the poverty line. Why will you not cover those who are above the poverty line in the healthcare scheme? They are the ones who are paying taxes. But the governments say that because they can afford the cost of treatment, they will not be covered. They first pay the taxes and then pay for their healthcare too,\" Jain said. इस बार आम आदमी पार्टी को वोट देने की वजह…5 फरवरी का दिन होगाझाड़ू चुनाव चिन्ह होगा #PhirLayengeKejriwal #DelhiElection2025 pic.twitter.com/6alVdLonsi — Satyendar Jain (@SatyendarJain) January 8, 2025 ‘WANT TAXPAYERS TO SEND KIDS TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS’ Speaking about education, he said the middle class pays the taxes, but the quality of education so far was so bad that their children could not enrol in those schools. “Why were public schools bad? Those who are actually paying for these schemes and schools are not able to benefit from them. We will consider ourselves successful only when the taxpayers will send their students to public schools. Our target is to cover all the health expenses from the day a child is born,\" Jain added. Now the question, he further said, will be why it took so long to achieve all this. Explaining this, Jain said climbing a high-rise building takes time and first the initial floors have to be climbed. “So far, the situation was so bad that everything and everyone was in the basement. Now we have managed to get to the middle floors. You can’t go to the 10th floor directly. I can assure our target and direction are right,\" he said. Jain is contesting for the fourth time from Shakur Basti. While the candidate from the Congress has been announced, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to announce its candidate against Jain. Reacting to this, he said: “The public doesn’t vote for the BJP based on the candidate. They may not even know who the candidate was. The BJP doesn’t have any issue or narrative.\" ‘WELL-WISHERS TOLD ME TO QUIT POLITICS’ Speaking about the case he is facing and his almost two-year-long prison stay, Jain said people are saying he should not have been sent to jail. “ Politics has its own place and should be done for a few months (around the elections). Post that, we are all citizens of this country. The aim should be to perform better than others and not stop others from working,\" Jain said.

First-time MP from Wayanad, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra spoke in the meeting asking for an explanation on how expenses will be cut down with the new legislation. She argued that the figures discussed by the government in its presentation made a reference to the parliamentary committee findings before 2004, while the electronic voting machine (EVM) was introduced only after this year, which meant that expenses were reduced. So, she has asked the government to respond to how it will justify post-2004 expenses and their further reduction.

(Representational image/PTI) The proposal to hold simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and all states, popularly known as the One Nation, One Poll (ONOP) plan, enjoys strong support among the country’s electorate, according to a nationwide News18 survey. Around 80.1% respondents to the survey, titled News18 Pulse: One Nation, One Election, said they support ONOP. Around 16% said they were not in favour of it, while 3.9% said they had no opinion on it. The support for ONOP, also called One Nation, One Election, was highest in central India, with 90.7% respondents saying they are in favour of it. Next came north India (87.3%) and east India (84%). related stories Support for simultaneous elections was relatively low in northeast India (73.9%) and west India (72.9%), and the least in south India (69.7%). According to the survey, 81.2% respondents are of the opinion that simultaneous polls will reduce the financial burden on the country. Over 80 per cent people surveyed believe that having fewer elections can ease daily life with lesser disruptions. It has been observed that every time elections take place, rallies lead to traffic woes for locals, and schools and offices are shut for a couple of days for polling. However, with elections once every 5 years, a majority of people believe this will reduce disruptions to day-to-day life. While 90 per cent people in north India believe One Nation One Election will make day-to-day life easy, at least 24.4 per cent in south India feel that may not be the case, as per the News18 survey. The ONOE Bill has been backed for making daily life easy by 87.4 per cent people in central India, 85.4 per cent in east India, 78.1 per cent from northeast India, 67.5 per cent in south India, and 72.6 per cent in west India. Overall, only 13.2 per cent people say that ONOE will lead to fewer disruptions in day-to-day life while 6 per cent said they were not sure whether or not that may happen. One of the questions was whether voters would face problems in differentiating between candidates and parties at national and state levels with simultaneous polls. According to a News18 Pulse survey, nearly 50 per cent respondents expressed confidence that there would be no confusion. As per the survey, 49.4 per cent of the respondents feel that voters will not face problems in differentiating between candidates and parties at national and state levels, compared to 39.1 per cent feeling otherwise. More respondents in south (46 per cent) and west (46.6 per cent) think that voters will face problems in differentiating between candidates and parties at national and state levels. Even among respondents who support the ONOE proposal, about a third, or 33.6 per cent of respondents feel that voters will face problems in differentiating between candidates and parties at national and state levels. However, 55.9 per cent respondents in central India, 62 per cent in east, 52 per cent in north and 44.7 per cent in northeast say that confusion over local and national candidates will not prevail when ONOE comes into effect. A total of 71.6% respondents think simultaneous elections will help align national and regional issues, leading to better policy decisions. Around 17.7% respondents disagree with the view, while 10.7% are not sure.

(PTI) At a time when former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s alleged expenditure spree over his ‘Sheesh Mahal’ has become an issue ahead of the polls scheduled for February 5 in the Capital, an RTI reply shows the contrast that both serving Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former PM Dr Manmohan Singh presented to the AAP chief. Singh and Modi, though divided by political spectrum and ideology, seem to be united by their belief in simple living. A latest query by RTI activist Prafful Sarda enquired about the cost for the “Deepavali Festival\" from 2014 to 2024 — the last 10 years of PM Modi’s rule — and 2004 to 2013 — 10 years of Manmohan Singh’s rule who passed away recently. The query also sought yearly breakup of the cost. related stories Interestingly, Parvesh Kumar of the Prime Minister’s Office was categorical in his reply when he said: “Personal expenses of the prime minister are not borne by government account.\" “This RTI query should serve as a reminder to our ministers, MPs, MLAs and even corporators, many of whom don’t think twice before splurging from the state exchequer’s money. But here we have two men — a sitting PM and a former PM — leading terms of 10 years with such example,\" Sarda told News18. The revelation comes at an interesting time when Delhi election dates have been announced and the leaked CAG report has put additional pressure on the Kejriwal government. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all BJP Delhi president Virendra Sachdeva alleged that the 2022 CAG report documented an expenditure of Rs 33.86 crore on the CM’s residence, dubbed the ‘Sheesh Mahal’. Sachdeva, however, claimed the actual cost was significantly higher — “Rs 75-80 crore if the inventory of the items in the bungalow is included\". Kejriwal’s entry into Indian politics was as an “aam aadmi\", fighting the ‘crony politics’ of UPA and Manmohan Singh.

AAP Dares BJP To Visit CM Residence With Media This comes after AAP MP Sanjay Singh on Tuesday challenged the BJP to visit the CM’s residence along with the media personnel, after the BJP levelled several allegations on the AAP over alleged misuse of public money in the construction of a luxurious residence for Kejriwal, the then-Delhi CM. The BJP has accused Arvind Kejriwal of spending an extravagant sum exceeding Rs 40 crore on renovating the Chief Minister’s official residence — an allegation the AAP has vehemently refuted. The AAP leaders dared the BJP to inspect the residence and substantiate their claims of excessive expenditure. AAP announced that its leaders, accompanied by the media, would visit the Civil Lines bungalow to address the allegations and then proceed to the Prime Minister’s residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, to highlight the renovations carried out there.

(File images) Even before the Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday announced February 5 as the date for bypoll in Ayodhya’s Milkipur, political parties began pulling out all stops to sway the electorate. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has set its sights on ‘Mission Milkipur’ in Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently said: “If Kundarki could be won, then why not Milkipur?\" The statement caused a stir in UP’s political circles, significantly raising the stakes for the upcoming bypoll. related stories The BJP has deployed six ministers to keep a vigilant eye on Milkipur, with CM Adityanath overseeing electoral preparations. On the other hand, the Samajwadi Party (SP) is banking on its trusted Picchda Dalit Alpsankhyak (PDA) formula to consolidate its vote base, setting the stage for an intense political battle. The bypoll is necessitated as Awadhesh Prasad, the MLA of Milkipur, which falls in Ayodhya on the border of Amethi and Sultanpur, got elected as an MP from Faizabad (Ayodhya).

It got votes in the name of development. It was due to party workers that we succeeded in winning seven of the nine seats in the UP bypolls,\" said Adityanath. The UP CM was addressing party workers at Acharya Narendra Dev Agricultural University in Ayodhya. He also told workers to get maximum votes at their respective booths. “Contact and communication is the best way to win. Party workers should compete among themselves to win their booth, gram sabha and mandal with maximum votes,\" the CM said. WHY KUNDARKI IS A BENCHMARK The UP CM’s statement created a flutter in political circles. “The Milkipur bypoll is no less than a battle of prestige for the BJP, especially after it lost the Ayodhya Lok Sabha seat to the SP in the April-June general elections in 2024. Of the other 9 seats for which bypolls were held, the Kundarki seat was critical, especially due to its complex caste equations. However, the BJP managed a decisive victory in the Muslim-dominated Kundarki seat in Moradabad, traditionally an SP stronghold. This also sets the benchmark and hence the party is in plans to apply the same strategy in Milkipur,\" said Shashikant Pandey, head department of political science Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow. SPLIT IN MUSLIM VOTES A KEY FACTOR IN KUNDARKI SUCCESS BJP’s Ramveer Thakur won Kundarki after a long wait of 31 years, with a margin of over 1.4 lakh. His closest rival and three-time MLA, SP’s Haji Rizwan, lost his bail amount, securing a mere 25,580 votes. Thakur created history by being the only Hindu candidate from the Muslim-dominated seat. “A split in Muslim votes was the main reason behind the BJP’s win. Barring the BJP, all parties, including the SP, fielded Muslim candidates,\" said Pandey. Adityanath also urged six ministers and party functionaries to intensify poll preparations and electorate mobilisation in Ayodhya’s Milkipur. While the BJP plans to push for Hindu unity with slogans such as ‘Batenge toh katenge’ (If we are divided, we’ll be slaughtered), the SP aims to retain its stronghold with its PDA strategy. MILKIPUR LIKELY TO SEE ‘PASI VS PASI’ There are rumours that the BJP may field former Milkipur MLA Baba Gorakhnath, a Pasi, who narrowly lost to SP’s Awadhesh Prasad in 2022 by 13,000 votes. Notably, in 2017, Gorakhnath, then 32, defeated the 72-year-old Prasad by more than 26,000 votes, a victory that coincided with the BJP’s landslide win in Uttar Pradesh and Adityanath’s rise to the chief minister’s office. The SP, too, is gearing up for the poll battle and is set to bank on its trusted PDA formula. The SP has fielded Awadhesh Prasad’s son, Ajit, a Pasi, turning the contest into a ‘Pasi vs Pasi’ battle in Milkipur, which has a significant Dalit and OBC population.

This is the process that all election commissioners follow, irrespective of annoucement for state or general elections. However, what makes Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar’s media interaction different is his style of addressing using ‘shayari’ or Urdu poetry. The announcement for 2025 Delhi election dates was no different. While responding to those questioning EVMs and the electoral process, Kumar on Tuesday said: “ Sab sawaal ki ehmiyat rakhte hain, jawab toh banta hai. Aadatan qalam-band jawab dete rahe, aaj roobaru bhi banta hai. Kya pata kal ho na ho, aaj jawab toh banta hai. \" related stories This loosely translates to: All questions are important. Hence, we must answer them. We usually have a habit of replying in writing but we must respond face-to-face today. We never know if tomorrow comes or not, hence replying to questions today is important.

Shikayat bhale hi unki majboori ho, magar sunna, sehna, suljhana humari aadat toh hai .\" This poetry loosely translates to: It’s alright even if they don’t agree. They still have faith in my loyalty. May be complaining is a compulsion for them. But it’s our habit to listen, bear and sort things out. Reciting his third ‘shayari’ on those doubting the work of Election Commission, Rajiv Kumar said, “ Aaropon aur ilzamaat ka daur chale, koi gila nahi.

(PTI) In the complex, caste-driven political landscape of Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar and RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav now seem to be maneuvering to maintain their political relevance. Amidst this, Prashant Kishor, with his Jan Suraaj Party, emerges as the potential political disruptor—not by securing seats or forming alliances, but by siphoning votes that could alter electoral outcomes. Kishor’s current approach to the BPSC (Bihar Public Service Commission) scam has revealed a deeper, wisely calculated political strategy which goes beyond just reacting to the issue at hand. His decision to start a hunger strike until the demand for re-examination is met, and his willingness to court arrest — including his refusal to sign a bail bond to remain in jail — speaks volumes about his political acumen and his intent. related stories The BPSC protest move is not merely about protesting against the scam. Instead, it is more about positioning himself as the voice of the people, especially Bihar’s youth, and also against an alleged corrupt system in the state as it is to go to polls in the next nine to 10 months. In the caste-based fractured society in the state, Kishor’s decision to take such a bold stance comes at a time when Bihar’s political landscape is readying for a major shift that may be seen in the next assembly polls. This clearly indicates how Kishor is capitalising on the growing and pent-up discontent surrounding issues like corruption, governance, and mismanagement in Bihar, all of which may sway public opinion in the lead-up to the state elections. By tying his personal actions to the larger narrative of political accountability, Kishor is now trying to position himself as a champion of transparency and justice, appealing to voters who are wary of the old political guard. Jan Suraaj and its sunlight moment Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party, which that was floated with much pomp and show on Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday on October 2, 2024, fought its first-ever election next month as the state saw bypolls in four assembly constituencies. The party, which was still at a nascent stage, fought on all four seats that went to bypolls. It had a strong showing in the bypolls, where it secured over 23 per cent votes on Imamganj seat and more than 11 per cent in Belganj, further solidifying Kishor’s political standing. For a first-time electoral outing, these results are quite impressive, signaling that Kishor’s message somewhat resonates with a significant portion of the electorate, despite the limited time and resources available to his party. This electoral success, combined with his latest protest actions, reflect that Kishor is not just looking to be a fleeting political figure, but is also preparing to be a key player in Bihar’s upcoming elections. His political-electoral strategy seems to be a calculated mix of grassroots mobilisation, some direct actions along with an emotional appeal, and having a high-pitched sub-regionalism or commonly called sub-nationalism through his slogan ‘Jai Bihar’. By taking such a visible stand against the BPSC scam, Kishor is not only addressing an issue that affects the common man and the unemployed but aspirational youth of Bihar, but also positioning himself as someone willing to fight for the people, even if it means taking a few personal risks. It is surely a message that aligns well with the electorate’s growing desire for change and reform in Bihar’s politics, especially as the state gears up for its next round of electoral battles. The sharp edge of the Bihar triangle Political experts feel that if Kishor continues with the momentum he created, he will be able to damage the voter base of both political stalwarts of Bihar — Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav. As both these politicians are now part of national alliances — NDA and INDIA bloc respectively — Kishor’s outreach may bring more harm to the RJD than it does to the JDU. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “Prashant Kishor has already done the frontal attack on JDU’s governance, exposing its failures in education policy and the BPSC scandal.

(AP) The stage is all set for the Delhi Dangal. The Election Commission on Tuesday announced the dates for the high-stakes assembly election to the Capital where voting will take place on February 5 and the results will be announced on February 8. The first major electoral battle of 2025 will see a triangular contest among the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Congress. The term of the Delhi assembly is due to end on February 23. related stories For the AAP, which has battled corruption charges and seen its top brass cool their heels in prison, the elections are a litmus test to prove that the party — which was birthed from an anti-corruption movement — still rules over the hearts of Delhiites. Arvind Kejriwal’s party, which has ruled Delhi with a full majority since 2015, is hoping that its schemes such as free electricity, water, and free bus rides for women, apart from a monthly stipend of Rs 2,100, free healthcare for the elderly, and a waiver of inflated water bills will help it retain power in the Capital. Meanwhile, the BJP, which has been out of power in Delhi for over 26 years, is keen to claw back power from Kejriwal and AAP. In a scathing attack on AAP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while kicking off BJP’s poll campaign, equated its rule in Delhi to “AAPda (disaster)\". The saffron party has upped the ante against the ruling AAP by targeting Kejriwal’s extravagant expenditure on the CM’s bungalow when he held the top post. For the Congress, the 2025 contest is a do-or-die battle. The Grand Old Party has been unable to open its account in the Capital — which it ruled for 15 years — in the previous two elections. Snubbed by the AAP, with whom it is fighting on the national level as part of the INDIA bloc, the Congress has been trying to revive its fortunes. It has promised Rs 2,500 monthly to women under the ‘Pyaari Didi Yojana’ if voted back to power. As the political temperatures rise, let’s take a look at key issues that have dominated and will continue to drive the Delhi discourse: CORRUPTION In an ironic turn of events, the AAP, which came to power on the anti-corruption plank, was embroiled in a liquor scam, faced cases of money laundering, and even faced barbs over the expensive renovation at the chief minister’s residence. The party’s top brass was forced to spend time in jail, ranging from six months to two years. However, now out on bail, the AAP has hit the electoral track running and accused the BJP of trying to implicate its leaders to intimidate them into jumping ship. The BJP, meanwhile, has accused Kejriwal of being the master puppeteer who knows all about the scams right under his nose. The party, while sharpening its attack on the former CM’s ‘Sheesh Mahal’, accused the AAP convener of diverting people’s money to fund his extravagant project. Home Minister Amit Shah alleged that over Rs 6 crore was spent on designer marbles, Rs 6 crore on motorised curtains, Rs 70 lakh on automatic doors, Rs 50 lakh on carpets and Rs 64 lakh on smart TVs at the chief minister’s residence when Kejriwal occupied it. The voter sentiment on the corruption issue seems divided. While many believe the AAP is a victim of vendetta politics, others feel the party has lost its sheen and joined the bandwagon of tainted outfits. CIVIC ISSUES Mounds of garbage, overflowing drains, water shortage or supply of dirty water and damaged roads have become major issues for voters in the Capital. While the BJP blames AAP for the urban apathy, the latter claims the saffron party has only tried to defame it and stall the work of the MCD. Delhi’s dwindling air quality, which returns to haunt the Capital in winters every year, has also become a bone of contention between the two parties. Unfortunately, the ultimate losers in the tug-of-war are Delhiites who are forced to deal with unaddressed civic issues. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all ROW OVER VOTER ROLLS The controversy over the alleged manipulation of electoral rolls in the Capital escalated after Delhi Chief Minister Atishi wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, seeking another round of verification of the voter deletions in the New Delhi assembly constituency.

(ECI) While announcing the schedule of Delhi Assembly elections, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar attempted to dispel the notions of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) being hacked by recalling tech mogul Elon Musk’s remarks last year that added fuel to the fire surrounding the debate on EVM credibility. The poll panel chief started answering the questions raised against alleged electoral roll, EVMs and voter turnout manipulation using his usual style of Shayaris, beginning by saying, “Aaj Jawab Toh Banta Hai.\" related stories Without mentioning his name, Kumar referred to Elon Musk’s previous remarks calling for EVMS to be “eliminated\" as they were at the risk of being hacked by humans or artificial intelligence. Musk had asserted that paper ballots were crucial for honest and fair elections. “It’s a misconceived narrative. A global IT expert said EVMs can be hacked while our elections were going on. They (America) don’t have EVMs, they have electronic voting mechanisms. The remarks created a pandemonium here. The same expert later said that India takes a single day to finish counting while the US takes over a month. We just follow the narratives that are suiting,\" Kumar said at the presser. The Chief Election Commissioner staunchly defended the voting system and rubbished the opposition’s claims of EVM tampering. After the recently held Maharashtra elections, concerns were raised by opposition parties over the surge in voter turnout post-evening. “EVMs are tamper-proof. They undergo scrutiny at every stage. From commissioning, which takes place around 7-8 days before polling day, to counting, the EVMs are never out of the sight of the candidate and officials even once and at every step, political party agents and candidates are informed,\" he said, adding that there was no question of hacking or rigging an EVM. What Did Elon Musk Say On EVMs? In June, just after the Lok Sabha elections that saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi returning to a historic third term in India, Elon Musk made headlines by calling for the “elimination\" of EVMs. “We should eliminate electronic voting machines. The risk of being hacked by humans or AI, while small, is still too high,\" he said on X. Responding to the remark, former Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar called Musk’s concerns a “huge sweeping generalisation\" and said Indian EVMs are custom-designed, secure and isolated from any network or media with no connectivity. “This is a huge sweeping generalization statement that implies no one can build secure digital hardware. Wrong. Elon Musk’s view may apply to the US and other places – where they use regular compute platforms to build Internet-connected Voting machines,\" Chandrasekhar wrote.

Democracy ends up becoming a sham and prone to fraud when institutions lack accountability,\" he added. The opposition parties have been raising concerns over EVMs for a long time and alleged EVM tampering in the Assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra last year.

In a competitive space, after women voters of Maharashtra rewarded the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress too unveiled its ‘Pyari Didi Yojana’ promising a monthly allowance of Rs 2,500 to eligible women.

The DEO further raised concerns about summons from Delhi Chief Minister Atishi. “The CM of GNCTD has been calling me for meetings without a specified agenda and in the past also, discussions regarding electoral rolls were held without prior notice,\" the DEO wrote.

Referring to an urgent meeting scheduled on January 4, 2025, he noted, “At 1:01 pm, a WhatsApp message from your office directed me to attend a meeting called by the CM at 2:00 pm. The agenda of the meeting has not been conveyed, making it difficult for me to come prepared.\" The DM emphasised that he was engaged in field verification tasks and requested that agendas for future meetings be shared in advance to allow for adequate preparation.

(Image: News18) Whether Arvind Kejriwal’s poll promise of Rs 2,100 to Delhi women bears fruit or not for the Aam Aadmi Party is yet to be seen, the probable beneficiaries of the ‘Mahila Samman’ scheme, however, seem to be in favour of a larger picture that shows them with a new skill and a job in hand. 54-year-old housewife Gayatri Yadav believes that a new skill training and a job, even if it pays Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 per month, would make women more independent and stronger in the longer run than Rs 2,100 in bank account from a government who will be elected just for five years. related stories “Even if I say this is good, how long can you expect the government to pay? The governments are there just for five years. What will happen if they are elected out of power? They themselves are saying the BJP will stop every free scheme they are offering. If the AAP really wants to empower women, there should be enough options for them to learn and work,\" she said while talking to News18. Echoing her sentiment, her relative Sumedha, in her 40s, added that this amount, if the government wishes, can be in addition to the money women will earn from a new job. “The scheme can be very helpful for women who are homeless or are beggars. But will they be eligible for this scheme? Do they have bank accounts? This money will go to women who are from well-to-do families. Those who really need this money can never get it,\" she said. Harshita Thapa, 38, believes that this money should be used by the government to make better facilities for women. “Look at the toilets across the city. Why cannot this money be used for building and maintaining toilets? The buses (DTC) are always crowded. Why cannot this money be used for bringing more buses? Will it not help women? It will not offer us a comfortable ride? All these issues are very common and faced by women across all the classes,\" she said. A group of women, in their 50s, also believed that the city government should provide some other form of relief and it should not be cash alone. Sangeeta Goel from Delhi Cantt, who was shopping with her friends in Janpath, said the scheme should be based on financial status of a woman. “This money should be used in some better form. Or at least it should be for women who are from poor families. It should not be for everyone. If it is for very poor women from the city, how will they register? They don’t have IDs and bank accounts and may also not be a voter in Delhi. Also, we know that husbands take away money from women for alcohol. There can be more steps to enhance safety for women,\" Goel said. The women assured that they will not register for the scheme as they opposed the idea. “People will take whatever they get for free. But the government should see what is important and what is not… The free electricity scheme is benefiting only a small section. The scope should be increased to cover more units. They can use this money in providing subsidies of some form… There should be efforts to check inflation,\" they said. The group believed that while on one hand the government provides something free to one section, it takes the money from the public in the form of some tax. Eventually it is the working class that is paying for everything free the government is providing to anyone. “The free water and electricity scheme is not enough. The middle class is not able to benefit from it. The money should be used to increase the scope,\" they said, adding that they also believe the money should not be given free but some skills and jobs for women. Some women were happy with the idea of getting Rs 2,100 but also added that they will believe in the scheme only if the money will actually start being credited to their account. One among these was a hawker Mangla in her 60s. A voter from New Delhi Assembly, she said these things are said only to seek votes but nothing changes on ground for the poor. “They say they will give us money in every election. But nothing changes for us. I spent my entire lifetime in Delhi. I saw the government coming and going. But there was no improvement in our situation. I earn Rs 200-300 daily.

A wildcard advantage for BJP could be the Congress and BSP contesting on all 70 seats and eating into AAP's votes reset Follow us on Google News Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks during a public meeting at Rohini in New Delhi on Sunday. (PTI) Can the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) end its 27-year-long power drought in Delhi? The party is employing a multi-pronged strategy to live up to this challenge as it senses “anti-incumbency\" against the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) decade-long rule, and feels that the narrative of AAP’s corruption and misgovernance has percolated to the masses. related stories The BJP’s campaign is also very localised this time, with the Prime Minister speaking about sewers and water-logged roads and the DTC fleet, in a marked shift from the ‘national’ issues campaign run by the BJP in Delhi in the past. The effort is to touch the pulse of the common Delhiite on the issues he is facing day in and day out. The BJP’s strategy seems to be on five political pillars, glimpses of which have been evident in the two public addresses of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi last week. #DelhiPolls | PM Narendra Modi sets the tone for Delhi elections: Hits top gear with ‘AAP’-da attacko @AmanKayamHai_ shares more details #Delhi #BJP #PMModi #AAP | @AvantikaInToday pic.twitter.com/tevMMGpMo3 — News18 (@CNNnews18) January 5, 2025 Modi is again the BJP’s face in Delhi and the party is not projecting any chief ministerial face. The PM and home minister Amit Shah are leading the attack on AAP on the ‘sheeshmahal’ campaign around the CM’s affluent residence, feeling this is AAP’s Achilles’ heel. The BJP is highlighting the AAP’s misgovernance from the state of the Yamuna to air pollution, to try to keep the campaign ‘local’. It says Delhi needs a ‘double-engine’ government run by the BJP. The BJP is planning a strong counter to AAP’s two major weapons – free electricity, and the Rs-2,100 promise to women. The BJP has also made a major overture to slum-dwellers who are a major vote bank, with Modi saying everyone will get a pucca home. The BJP is hoping that the Congress and the BSP will dent AAP’s votes in multiple seats, and the BJP may gain from it. MODI IS THE FACE Leading the charge against the AAP again is the BJP’s top face, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This was also the case in 2020 when the BJP lost. The BJP had projected Kiran Bedi as their chief ministerial face in 2015, but that ended in a disaster as the AAP won as many as 67 out of the 70 seats in Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal and his party are taking potshots at the BJP asking who their “dulha\" (bridegroom) is in these elections. But the BJP feels that there are bigger issues in this election than a CM face. It is buoyed by the wins in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in 2023 without projecting any CM face. The two posters released by the BJP so far only have Modi as the face on them. The BJP feels the AAP has complicated its own strategy by saying that Kejriwal will replace Atishi as the CM if the AAP wins, despite the Supreme Court putting stiff conditions on Kejriwal while granting him bail.

This explains PM Modi and Shah leading the attack on the issue. “I never built a house for myself…I could also have built a sheeshmahal but my dream has been that the poor get a concrete house,\" PM Modi said at a rally on Friday. A latest CAG report , which has not been tabled in the Delhi Assembly yet, has also posed serious questions on the lavish expenditure on refurbishing and renovating the CM’s residence in Delhi. The PM has led the attack on this CAG report as well, saying Kejriwal was focused on building the “sheeshmahal\" at a time when the national capital was struggling with Covid. FAILED GOVERNANCE MODEL The BJP is also doubling down on the state of the Yamuna river, and the persistent air pollution issue in the national capital, to corner the AAP’s governance model in Delhi.

Explaining The Mammoth Exercise Reported By : Nivedita Singh News18.com Edited By: Apoorva Misra Last Updated: January 04, 2025, 15:52 IST The updation or addition of names requires house-to-house survey, physical field verification, display and sharing of list of claims and objections, supervision and random checking reset Follow us on Google News The creation, maintenance and purification of electoral rolls is the core constitutional responsibility of the EC. (Getty) Before every election, political parties get into a verbal clash over the updation of electoral rolls. Now, as Delhi is gearing up for assembly polls, the picture is no different. While the opposition BJP is accusing AAP of adding unauthorised names in the list, the latter has been attacking the saffron party for deletion of valid names. In February 2024, the BJP filed a complaint with the Election Commission (EC) that West Bengal has 16 lakh fake voters. In January 2024, similar issues were raised in Andhra Pradesh when the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the BJP filed a complaint over ‘fake names’ in the state voters’ list. When Maharashtra went to polls in November 2024, Congress raised the issue again. In 2018 and 2019, before the Lok Sabha polls, BJP and AAP indulged in similar blame-games in Delhi. related stories But how exactly are names added and deleted from the electoral roll? Is it really possible to delete or add names by simply directing the Election Commission’s office? The answer is no. The updation or addition of names requires house-to-house survey, physical field verification, display and sharing of list of claims and objections, supervision and random checking. It also involves sharing of draft and final electoral roll with political parties. There is also a rigorous Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) for deletion of names. Speaking to News18, a poll body official said the creation, maintenance and purification of electoral rolls is the core constitutional responsibility of the EC, with a well-defined and meticulously followed legacy over decades. “The credibility of the process is organically linked to data/facts over several revisions and continuous updation of previous data sets. The process is ensconced in a watertight statutory scheme which is rule-based,\" they said. The EC, they said, firmly believes that an inclusive, healthy, pure and transparently prepared electoral roll is the foundation of free, fair and credible elections. Involving All Stakeholders For a pure and healthy electoral roll, rules are followed from Article 324 of the Constitution of India, provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, Registration of the Electors Rules, 1960, and the extant instructions issued by the commission from time to time. All political parties are made aware of the SoPs for Special Summary Revision (SSR) and the special measures taken during SSR. Additions and deletions take place after due enquiry, in full public view and with participation of political parties at every stage of the process. Every entry in the electoral roll database, either by way of addition or deletion or transportation, is credible, as it is based on voluntariness of the citizen to enrol and an open disclosure and public hearing to objections, if any and, thereafter, the entries are available for perpetual scrutiny and legal challenge. To ensure that each and every information is available with the various stakeholders, free copies of the draft and final electoral rolls, along with weekly lists of claims and objections, are provided to recognised political parties to make them aware about the process to avoid any post facto objection or grievances. The draft and final rolls are hosted on the CEO/ District Election Officer (DEO) websites and the rolls are displayed at designated polling stations location and Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) offices notice board. During the continuous updation period, monthly pooling of lists of additions, deletions, and modifications are published on the website of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) for the information of the general public. EC has provided the provision of the appointment of Booth Level Agents (BLA) by the recognised political parties as an extra facilitation to them, ensuring utmost transparency in the process. BLAs do not interfere with the registration process and in the functioning of Booth Level Officer (BLOs) but only identify and flag any discrepancy or impurity in the electoral roll of the polling station/party concerned. Enrolling Every Eligible Citizen The ECI even allows homeless people to get registered as voters. For that, the Booth Level Officer visits the address given in Form 6 at night to ascertain that the homeless person actually sleeps at the place which is given as his address in Form 6. If the Booth Level Officer is able to verify that the homeless person actually sleeps at that place, no documentary proof of plac...",

(PTI) The last time the Delhi Assembly witnessed a question hour was in December 2023. In the 24 sessions held in the year 2024, there was no question hour — one of the most critical aspects of democracy. Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel, while speaking to News18, said there were two reasons behind the unusual phenomenon. The first, he said, was late or lack of reply from the departments as it was often said that the subject was out of the Delhi government’s control. related stories “Question Hour was being held and MLAs were asking questions but there was no reply. The MLAs got fed up and stopped asking questions…There is another reason that Question Hour is not held many times as there was no notice of 12 ‘clear’ days between the announcement of session and the actual session date,\" he told News18. Goel added: “There are so many questions around Delhi Development Authority (DDA), including why land is not being allocated. Replies are not coming from the revenue department as they say DDA is not under them. Similarly, if there is any question around services, the department turns it down and refuses to answer. If someone asks questions on law and order, it is said this is not a subject of the Delhi government… All the important issues were left behind,\" he said. Delhi is a Union Territory with an assembly. The city government does not have control over land, law and order and services. As per the official website of the Delhi Assembly, the rules for Question and Answer state that no less than 12 days’ notice is to be given in writing to the assembly secretary. ‘Clear days’ include Saturdays, Sundays and holidays but do not include the date of receipt of a notice by the Secretariat. It also says members have a right to ask questions to elicit information on matters of public importance from the government. The Question Hour is the most popular device available to a member to raise issues in the House. “Rule 29 of the Delhi Assembly Rules states that a question must relate to a matter of administration for which the Government is responsible. Its purpose should be to elicit information or to give suggestions of action on a matter of public importance,\" the rules read. In December 2023, when a three-day session was called, 252 notices of questions were received. Since 2020, when the term of the current assembly started, a total of 1,095 questions have been listed. Question Hour was also not held in 2020 and 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic that had curtailed sessions. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The BJP, which is in opposition in the assembly, has made demands to include Question Hour multiple times in the past few weeks.

(PTI) The stage is set for an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi. Having come late to the poll fest despite earlier ruling the Capital for three terms, the Congress — snubbed by AAP — doesn’t want to cede an inch. Hence, similar to the guarantees it announced in other poll-bound states like Haryana and Maharashtra, in Delhi too, the Grand Old Party will announce five guarantees in a phased manner. related stories The idea behind phasing out the announcements is to ensure it keeps the momentum going and also so that the party can tweak its promises along the way in line with what other parties announce. Sources say the five guarantees to be announced from January 6-11 are: 1. Direct Cash Transfer for Women: Aimed at empowering women voters, the Congress plans to introduce a direct cash transfer scheme. 2. Comprehensive Insurance Coverage: The party intends to offer insurance coverage worth over Rs 20-25 lakh for all residents, enhancing social security across the Capital. 3. Support for Unemployed Youth: To address unemployment, the Congress proposes cash incentives for jobless youth, coupled with apprenticeship training programmes to enhance their skills and employability. 4. Unique Ration Kits for Households: In an effort to support families, a distinctive ration kit containing daily essentials will be provided to households, ensuring access to necessary commodities. 5. Electricity: Like the AAP, the Congress too will announce free electricity up to 400 watts for lower-income group areas. The Congress has a tough fight ahead as it has to challenge both the BJP and the AAP in a race where it has lagged behind. The AAP-Congress divorce means the INDIA bloc is doddering. The Congress also wants to target the same vote bank that it shares with AAP which has grown in Delhi at the cost of the Grand Old Party. While the latter hopes to rectify this, the task is easier said than done. At the announcement of another sop from AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, where he promised to waive off inflated electricity bills if his party comes to power, the former Delhi chief minister dismissed the Congress, saying: “Why do you take the Congress seriously?

(Image: PTI) As AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday launched the ‘Pujari Granthi Samman Yojana’ , promising a monthly allowance of Rs 18,000 for temple priests and granthis of gurdwaras, a political war of words raged over the scheme with the BJP calling Arvind Kejriwal “chunavi Hindu\". The BJP mocked Kejriwal in a post on social media platform ‘X’, showing him in a priest-like avatar similar to a character in Bollywood film ‘Bhool Bhulaiyaa’. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also retaliated with a poster of its own “challenging\" the BJP to introduce a similar scheme in the 20 states ruled by the party. related stories In one of its major poll promises, the AAP on Monday (December 30) announced that it will launch the scheme if it is re-elected in Delhi. Kejriwal launched the scheme earlier in the day, registering the priest of Marghat Wale Baba temple near Kashmere Gate ISBT, following which Chief Minister Atishi visited a gurdwara in Karol Bagh to conduct registrations. The former chief minister said this process will be followed at other temples and gurdwaras across the city by AAP workers. He alleged that the BJP tried its best, but no one can stop a devotee from meeting the god. He added that he will visit the Prachin Hanuman Mandir at Connaught Place to register the priests there. But, as the politics over the honorarium gathered momentum in Delhi, a group of priests staged a protest against him outside the temple for announcing the honorarium after a delay of 10 years. WHAT IS THE BJP SAYING? In its poster mocking Arvind Kejriwal, the BJP called him a “chunavi Hindu\" (Hindu for electoral purposes), saying “visiting temples was a mere illusion\" for the AAP leader. The party said he had “ridiculed Sanatan Dharma\" at every step of his political career and the Pujari Granthi Samman Yojana was simply an “electoral gimmick\". चुनावी हिंदू केजरीवाल🔳जो 10 साल से इमामों को सैलरी बांटता रहा🔳जो ख़ुद और उनकी नानी प्रभु श्रीराम का मंदिर बनने से खुश नहीं थे🔳जिसने मंदिर और गुरुद्वारों के बाहर शराब के ठेके खोले🔳जिसकी पूरी राजनीति हिन्दू विरोधी रही उसे अब चुनाव आते ही पुजारियों और ग्रंथियों की याद आई? pic.twitter.com/KMKntiOlXW — BJP Delhi (@BJP4Delhi) December 31, 2024 Delhi BJP leaders joined the chorus against the AAP and Kejriwal, with MP Bansuri Swaraj calling the scheme an “appeasement\" move ahead of the assembly polls. In a press conference, she challenged the AAP chief to implement the schemes announced by him, including the ‘Mahila Samman Yojna’, saying there is no model code of conduct in place. Bansuri said the AAP government was unable to pay Rs 18,000 to imams of mosques for months due to lack of funds and yet Kejriwal was trying to appease the priests and granthis just before the elections. She questioned why there was no honorarium for hem in the last 10 years. Addressing a press conference, BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia dubbed the announcement of the monthly honorarium as yet another “false promise\" by the AAP. He claimed that the AAP leader knows his “political life\" is coming to an end. He further said until recently his government was opening liquor shops outside religious places. He noted that the AAP government has also promised a similar amount to imams, but has not paid them for 17 months. “There has been no bigger fraud and deceitful politician in India than him,\" he alleged.

Former Delhi MP Parvesh Verma said Kejriwal is remembering ishwar and waheguru due to the fear of loss. But he did not remember them for the last 10 years, only remembering maulvis of the mosque, and saw only one religion and one vote bank. HOW DID THE AAP RESPOND?

The statement comes amid claim by sources that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is likely to consult other parties of the INDIA bloc to remove the grand old party from the alliance. The move could be a big blow to the opposition unity ahead of the upcoming Delhi elections.

AAP leader Sanjay Singh said that they want Congress to take action against Ajay Maken for calling Kejriwal “anti-national\". “Otherwise we will talk to other allies of INDIA bloc to remove Congress from alliance,\" he threatened. Amid Row Over Ads, A New Controversy Over Ajay Maken’s Remark After the massive row over advertisements erupted on Wednesday, Maken said that the grand old party’s decision to support the AAP in 2013 led to its decline in Delhi.

Akhilesh Yadav ji has already said that AAP can defeat BJP in Delhi. So we will support Kejriwal’s party. The dignity of language should always be maintained,\" he added.

Suri called Atishi’s allegations “low thinking of CM and AAP\". “No Congressman is going to take money from BJP. Anyone can check my family background. It’s nothing but a foolish talk.

Kejriwal, who has said time and again that a lot of voters are being removed from the electoral roll ahead of the Delhi assembly elections, asked potential beneficiaries to check their names in the voter list.

All the women in a household will be registered and given a card. “You need to keep that card safe,\" he added. On the Sanjivani Yojana, under which all senior citizens in Delhi will be entitled to free medical treatment, Kejriwal said there is no one to care for the middle class in India. He said no government had done anything for them and many people work hard as well as pay taxes worth lakhs and crores to contribute for nation building. “When they are retired, there is no one to take care of them. Health is a major issue in old age. I want to tell them all that now you don’t have to worry. The AAP will take care of your medical expenses. The registration for this scheme will also be done from Monday door to door,\" he said. He also said for these schemes, the beneficiaries need to be a voter in Delhi so people should keep their voter card ready when the registration team arrives. “You should also check that your name is not deleted from the voter list. A lot of voters are being removed from the list. They (BJP) don’t want you to get the benefit of these schemes. If your name is removed, please tell the visiting team about it. We will add you to the list,\" he added.

Hitting out at opposition BJP, he said the party lacked vision for Delhi. “For the entire election in Delhi, they (BJP) don’t have any narrative and vision for the people of Delhi.

(PTI) Delhi L-G VK Saxena’s go-ahead to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to prosecute former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has heated up the scene for Delhi polls that could take place in February. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was formed on the plank of ending corruption, with Kejriwal projecting himself as a “clean politician\". However, the BJP and Congress have relentlessly attacked and questioned these credentials. related stories The first reaction to the L-G’s move came from Kejriwal’s aide and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia who said on X: “If the L-G has given the go-ahead to ED to prosecute, then where is the copy of this? It’s clear this is a rumour.\" In fact, all AAP leaders have questioned and asked for proof of the L-G’s approval. Whatever may be the case, the AAP is bound to use the development to make the point that the BJP is rattled and is once again misusing agencies to arm-twist its opponents. Not just this, AAP will also try to incur sympathy and use this to reach out to its voters for Delhi polls. But, for the BJP, this is proof they would want to flaunt to show that the AAP is soaked in corruption — right up to the top. It maintains that the liquor-gate issue is one which shows that the former chief minister is the “kingpin\" and he cannot escape culpability. They are also making the point that the ED note gives evidence of hotel stay and money emanating from the former CM’s office and if he comes back to power, corruption will be at its peak, with benefits not going to the people. BJP Delhi president Virendra Sachdeva has said: “It is clear that Kejriwal is the kingpin of the Delhi excise policy scam and as investigation progresses, he will be punished.\" For the BJP, it’s a do-or-die battle. Being out of power in Delhi for the last 12 years, it’s important for the party to bounce back and ensure that one of the bastions of the INDIA bloc crumbles. BJP knows that if AAP loses in Delhi, Punjab too could be up for grabs. For the Congress, it’s a tough fight. However, despite the flip-flop in the party over the alliance with AAP, the Congress has decided to fight back. In fact, Sheila Dikshit’s son and former MP Sandeep Dikshit has been fielded opposite Kejriwal. He told News18 recently: “This was expected and it is something that should have been done earlier. There was enough evidence to prosecute him.\" Interestingly, it was the Congress that had first raised the liquor-gate issue against Kejriwal when they were not friends. For now, the game is on and the BJP and AAP will fight on the corruption slogan in the battle for Delhi. What is the excise scam? The excise case pertains to alleged corruption and money laundering in formulating and executing the Delhi government’s excise policy for 2021-22, which was later scrapped. L-G Saxena had recommended a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities. Subsequently, the ED registered a case under the PMLA. Kejriwal, 55, and the AAP have been named as accused in the supplementary charge sheet filed in the case.

(X) Ahead of the 2025 Delhi elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is taking a leaf out of rival Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s playbook. In the 2020 polls, the party’s vote share was 38.51 per cent, while that of the AAP was 53.57 per cent. The massive gap of 15 per cent meant the BJP won just eight seats out of 70, ensuring an AAP sweep with 62 seats. Cut to December 2024, the BJP is actively trying to win over two loyal bases of AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal to minimise the gap — auto drivers and slum dwellers. related stories DENT IN 93,000 FAMILIES’ VOTES Auto drivers are considered traditional supporters of AAP since its anti-corruption movement when the vehicle was used to disseminate anti-Congress messaging. When India Against Corruption metamorphosed into AAP, auto drivers remained loyal to Kejriwal and the party reaped its political benefit in successive polls. There are an estimated 93,000 auto-rickshaws in Delhi, which are being counted as 93,000 families and their votes — a vote bank that BJP is aggressively attempting to win over sensing a mistrust against AAP among a section of auto drivers ever since Kejriwal’s alleged flamboyant lifestyle hit headlines. Kejriwal’s success in capturing this base very early was by identifying himself as a commoner fighting the system. Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva engaged with auto drivers over tea at the Nizamuddin Railway Station on Wednesday, claiming Kejriwal did not fulfil basic promises like auto stands or stopping the practice of rampant seizing of autos. “In 2014, Kejriwal made 10 promises to auto drivers. However, neither were those promises were fulfilled, nor any efforts were made by his government towards fulfilling them,\" Sachdeva alleged. On Monday too, Sachdeva addressed more than 1,000 auto drivers from central and west districts of Delhi, explaining to them why Kejriwal had failed them. BJP insiders say even if the party is able to swing 30-40 per cent of Delhi’s 93,000 auto drivers towards itself, it will help BJP increase its vote share. TARGET: WIN BACK 1,194 SLUMS If auto drivers were one of AAP’s earliest allies, even before they took the political plunge, votes across Delhi’s 1,194 slum clusters — known as jhuggi jhopri colonies — too have been steadfast in their support for the broom since an early stage. However, with Kejriwal’s ‘Common Man’ image taking a severe beating with allegations of irregularities over the alleged liquor scam and reports of opulence on display in the name of renovation of his official residence, many residents of these slum clusters started feeling a disconnect from AAP. The BJP was quick to exploit it. Party leaders stayed overnight in 1,194 slum clusters across the city to interact directly with the residents and understand their challenges. During the overnight stay, the BJP leaders dined with residents, keeping it as real as possible. For instance, Sachdeva had a meal with slum dwellers as part of the night slum stay campaign at Rajiv Camp in Jhilmil. He wasn’t alone. BJP’s national general secretary Dushyant Gautam and MP Ramvir Singh Bidhuri are among many who took part in this outreach. BJP, under the Slum Expansion Campaign, has appointed slum-expanders or vistaraks and slum-caretakers who are tasked to run the drive across Delhi, once the leaders leave. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Sources say feedback has also started pouring in. A major concern among some slum dwellers has been whether their slums will be destroyed after being deemed illegal, particularly after chief minister Atishi held a press conference. Few other concerns are timely water supply, fumigation during monsoon and food through the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB). The BJP is hopeful that unless some major freebie announcements are made for the urban poor before poll date declaration, they are on the right course to stake claim on two of Kejriwal’s most treasured bases. tags : aam aadmi party arvind kejriwal BJP delhi elections news18 specials Location : New Delhi, India First Published: December 18, 2024, 12:11 IST News elections Delhi Polls: BJP Targets AAP’s Loyal Base Of Auto Drivers, Slum Clusters To Bridge 15% Vote Share Gap Read More",

In the first two lists, the AAP fielded 13 turncoats including those from the BJP like Brahm Singh Tanwar (Chhatarpur) and Jitender Singh Shunty (Shahdara). Kejriwal’s party has announced candidates on all 70 seats. On Monday, Delhi BJP President Virendraa Sachdeva held a closed-door meeting on what the party called organisational work and a future course of action was discussed.

(PTI File) As Bihar prepares for assembly elections next year, women are once again at the heart of the campaigns. Even as Janata Dal United (JDU) chief and CM Nitish Kumar started his ‘Mahila Samvad Yatra’, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) announced ‘Mai Bahan Maan Yojana’ (MBMY). Former Deputy CM and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav announced that if voted to power, his government would transfer Rs 2,500 every month in the bank accounts of “economically disadvantaged women and those from deprived sections of society\". related stories “This scheme will be launched and implemented within one month of the formation of our government in the state,\" he said. The scheme has been labelled as “RJD’s vision to empower women and bring happiness and security in every such household across the state\". RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said the announcement is a commitment towards women of Bihar. “This should not be seen only as an election stunt. Tejaswi Yadav earlier, too, has displayed his commitment towards the youth of Bihar by delivering on the promise of jobs. Now, he has announced money in the hands of women. Together, the schemes will make Bihari prosperous,\" Jha said. WOMEN VOTE BANK Yadav’s announcement in Darbhanga is seen as an attempt to woo women voters who have emerged as a vote bank in the recent elections. Women are traditionally seen as Nitish backers, especially supporting him in his liquor ban crusade. The RJD might be attempting to take a leaf out of the BJP’s playbook in MP and Maharashtra and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha’s in Jharkhand to derail this crucial base of Nitish Kumar. Analysts believe that in the recently concluded elections in Jharkhand, Hemant Soren’s Maiya Samman Yojana ensured absolute majority for the JMM in spite of a stiff challenge from the BJP. Soren had promised to hike the Maiya Samman monthly pay to Rs 2,500 if voted to power.

(PTI) After receiving back-to-back complaints from Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and opposition BJP, the Election Commission of India on Friday wrote to the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of the Capital to follow strict protocol and keep the political parties in the loop about the Special Summary Revision in the city ahead of the scheduled assembly elections. Both the parties had knocked on the EC’s door, alleging irregularities in the electoral roll. related stories In its letter, the EC reiterated that the issues raised in representations of both the parties — BJP’s demand to delete illegal/temporary migrants, ghost voters, and AAP’s plea to not undertake mass deletions of voters without proper enquiry — have to be examined carefully and necessary action taken strictly following the laid-down statutory provisions and guidelines contained in the manual of electoral rolls. The EC directed the CEO that no deletion can take place without a corresponding Form-7 and all cases of deletions must be personally cross-verified by the Electoral Registration Officer if they fall in any of the two categories — deletions in polling stations where the number of deletions exceed 2 per cent of the total electors in the voter list of the polling station; and deletions where the same person is the objector in more than five cases. “I am directed to convey that the extant process should be scrupulously followed by the entire machinery involved in the revision process, including EROs, AEROs, BLO supervisors and BLOs, so as to ensure that changes in the electoral roll during the SSR period are backed by proper enquiry with fullest possible participation of the political parties,\" the ECI said. The list of claims and objections, including Form-7, should regularly be shared with all political parties and also be uploaded on the website of CEO Delhi, the EC said. “The objections to these claims and objections, including those raised by BLAs (Booth Level Agents) of the political parties before the concerned BLO/ERO, must be disposed of after proper scrutiny/hearing of the concerned,\" the letter added. BJP Demands Action Against Bogus Voting The EC letter was issued hours after the BJP delegation, led by its president Virendra Sachdeva, met the commission on Friday. The party lodged a protest against the enrollment of ‘lakhs of illegal infiltrator Rohingyas and Bangladeshi origin’ voters apart from duplicate voters, non-existent address voters and thousands of dead persons in the voter lists of Delhi. The BJP, with their 5,000 pages of evidence, demanded that the EC look into their complaint on legal merits on priority to ensure a true and transparent election for Delhi assembly. “…It’s surprising that new voter registration of lakhs of voters happens every time between the period of conclusion of Lok Sabha elections and start of assembly elections in Delhi which is abnormally higher than in the yearly voter summary revision exercise,\" the BJP said. Sachdeva said they will not let infiltrators and bogus voters vote, requesting the EC to run a campaign against enrollment of illegal voters as well as against illegal voting. Sachdeva said BJP BLAs and other workers have been visiting all 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi and have found the existence of lakhs of Bangladeshi or Rohingya-origin infiltrators registered as voters apart from duplicate voters and non-existent address voters. “Every constituency in Delhi has a huge number of dead or permanently shifted voters in Delhi.,\" they said. AAP Wants Action Against Mass Deletions AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday met the commission and a day later also wrote to Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar.

That was the year when an activist and Income Tax officer Arvind Kejriwal was battle ready to take on three-time Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit from the New Delhi constituency, considered to be a fortress of the Congress. The result left many shocked as Kejriwal defeated her with over 25,000 votes, vowing to “send the corrupt CM to jail.\" After almost 11 years, Sheila Dikshit’s son Sandeep is getting ready to breach this bastion, which is now with Kejriwal.

I see it as a fight to reclaim what was once a clean, green, developed Delhi.

It also now makes it clear that the Congress is no longer shying away from a direct fight with the AAP after Kejriwal snubbed the party and announced that he would have no alliance with them in Delhi. “Of course, I am very happy we are not going into an alliance with the AAP.

Several flyovers, development projects, roads, clean vehicles were her contribution. This is what we will build our campaign on,\" Sandeep said. There was a grudge that the Congress had used and thrown Sheila Dikshit and had neglected her in her last years.

(PTI) It was the winter of 2021 and political parties were getting ready for the Punjab assembly polls when Arvind Kejriwal, chief of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), came out with five guarantees — including crediting Rs 1,000 per month into the account of every woman in the state — if the party wins. Kejriwal promised that all the women in a house, who were above the age of 18 years, would be given Rs 1,000 per month if they registered for the scheme. So, if a house had more than one adult woman, the money would be given to each individual. related stories When elections were held in February 2022, AAP swept the polls with a clear majority, winning 92 of 117 seats. Over time, the party fulfilled all its promises and guarantees. Yet, the promise to women could not be fulfilled, even as the government is set to complete three years in the next few weeks. Speaking to News18, a state party leader said they are well aware that the guarantee is “pending\". “It is not that we have forgotten what we promised. For every scheme that a government implements, a lot of planning is done. The work is underway and very soon, women will start getting the money. We never said we will not do that. We have already fulfilled four guarantees even before completing two years. We are the only party in India that delivers every promise. Soon, we will get the good news for this scheme also,\" the leader said, without getting into the details of the timeline. As against the term ‘promise’ used by political parties and their leaders, AAP opts for the word ‘guarantee’. “When we say guarantee, it means the work will be done, no matter what. As giving money to women was a guarantee, it will also be done,\" the leader added. Even before elections were held in Punjab, Kejriwal had started registrations for the scheme. In May this year, the Bhagwant Mann government said they will give Rs 1,100 to women instead of Rs 1,000 per month. However, in the state budget of 2024-25, no funds were allocated for the scheme. Mann had said his government would redirect funds from other schemes for the payment but nothing concrete has taken shape so far. Punjab Formula Repeated in Delhi What happened in Punjab in 2021-22 is now being repeated by Kejriwal in Delhi where elections are due in February 2025. Though the former chief minister made a similar announcement for women in the national capital, the difference was the scheme did get cleared by the Cabinet though it has a long journey ahead. Apart from other steps, the scheme will also have to get clearance from the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. On Thursday, the Delhi Cabinet cleared the ‘Mahila Samman Yojana’ for the city under which Rs 1,000 per month will be credited to the account of every woman who lives in the national capital and registers for the scheme. While making the announcement, Kejriwal said the cabinet approval is for Rs 1,000, but he will give Rs 2,100 per month to every woman after the elections are over and the party forms the next government. The registration of the scheme will start from Friday, he said, although the amount may only be credited after the formation of the new government. “We announced that we will give Rs 1,000 to every woman every month in their bank accounts. Today, under the leadership of chief minister Atishi, the cabinet cleared the proposal to give Rs 1,000 in every woman’s bank account,\" Kejriwal said. He said with this announcement, the scheme has been launched in Delhi for which women need to register. The initial announcement for the scheme was done in March and Kejriwal said he was expecting the scheme may be launched by May. Addressing the questions raised by the opposition on the freebies provided by his government, Kejriwal said he knows how to get the money, how to manage it and how to spend it. “When I first said electricity will be free, they said the government does not have funds but we did it… people were saying it is not possible. But if Kejriwal decides something, he will do it,\" he said, calling himself a “magician\". top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Kejriwal also said while the scheme has been launched, the money may not be credited to accounts as elections will be announced in the next 10-15 days. “I believe if each and every woman votes for us, we will get at least 60-65 seats in Delhi,\" Kejriwal said. The current term of the 70-member assembly will end in February 2025...",

He clarified that there was “no possibility of any alliance with Congress\". related stories Congress and AAP are in the final stages of agreement for an alliance in the Delhi elections. 15 seats for Congress, 1-2 to other INDIA Alliance members and the rest for AAP: Sources— ANI (@ANI) December 11, 2024 With this, he ended the speculations about a possible seat-sharing formula with Congress in the elections scheduled for February, next year. There was a buzz that 15 seats would be reserved for Congress, one or two for other INDIA bloc members, and the rest for AAP. Kejriwal has been consistent about his stance on the poll alliance. Earlier this month, in a major jolt to the Opposition’s INDIA bloc, the former Delhi Chief Minister had ruled out any alliance with Congress for the 2025 Assembly Elections in the national capital . The announcement came in continuation with the AAP’s move in the Haryana Assembly polls in October this year in which the party had ditched the INDIA bloc and contested the polls on its own. The AAP and Congress had attempted to forge an alliance in Haryana, however, the seat-sharing talks did not yield any conclusion. Kejriwal’s decision also comes on the back of major poll drubbing of the Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra this month, which Congress is also a part of, drawing criticism from its allies. Congress-AAP Alliance In Lok Sabha Polls The Congress and AAP had contested the Lok Sabha Elections this year in Delhi in alliance with each other under the umbrella of the INDIA bloc. Both parties had even campaigned for each other. Kejriwal, who was then out on interim bail for the election campaigning, had also campaigned for the Congress and had sought votes for its Opposition party (in the Delhi Assembly). top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all AAP had contested on 4 seats while Congress on 3 seats out of 7 parliamentary constituencies in Delhi.

(PTI) The past 10 days have been particularly challenging for Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde. Not only did Shinde face health issues, but he also endured mounting pressure to join the Devendra Fadnavis -led government as Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister. Having served as chief minister for two-and-a-half years, Shinde initially resisted the idea of stepping into a secondary role, citing a preference to focus on strengthening the party’s organisation. Speculation about internal discord within the Mahayuti alliance grew when Shinde retreated to his native village in Satara. However, he returned to Mumbai after a brief hiatus and resumed deliberations with key alliance leaders. The interactions with chief minister-elect Fadnavis at the CM’s official residence, Varsha Bungalow, were pivotal in persuading Shinde to accept the deputy CM role. related stories Fadnavis played a central role in this decision-making process. After staking claim to form the government, Fadnavis visited Shinde at Varsha to urge him to join the cabinet. During their 20-minute meeting, Shinde expressed reservations but was reportedly assured a fair distribution of key portfolios, including the home department, MSRDC, and energy, which are crucial for both governance and his party’s political standing.

I have full faith he will join us.\" Shiv Sena MLAs and former cabinet colleagues also played a significant role in convincing Shinde. Sources indicate that Shinde initially wanted a senior party leader to assume the role of deputy CM. However, persistent demands from MLAs, MPs, and Shiv Sainiks across the state forced him to reconsider. Prominent Shiv Sena leaders emphasised the necessity of Shinde’s participation in the new government to maintain party morale and unity. Party MLA Bharat Gogavale said, “We urged him to be part of the government as this will help both the party and the administration.\" Similarly, Uday Samant pointed out that around 60-61 MLAs, including independents, firmly backed Shinde for the position, reflecting a strong consensus within the party.

Accepting the deputy chief minister role would reinforce Shiv Sena’s presence in the government and ensure the party’s interests remain safeguarded. However, it also risked being perceived as a step down after his tenure as chief minister. Declining the post, on the other hand, could weaken Shiv Sena’s influence within the Mahayuti alliance and jeopardise its future political prospects. Shinde’s decision to join the Fadnavis-led government as deputy chief minister is a significant moment in Maharashtra’s political landscape. It ensures Shiv Sena’s continued relevance within the ruling coalition and reinforces Shinde’s leadership within the party. The assurances of a fair portfolio distribution also underline the importance of maintaining coalition harmony while addressing internal demands. As Maharashtra embarks on this new chapter under the Mahayuti government, Shinde’s role will remain crucial in shaping governance and political dynamics in the state. tags : Devendra Fadnavis eknath shinde Home Ministry mahayuti news18 specials Location : Mumbai, India First Published: December 05, 2024, 09:54 IST News elections How Fadnavis Got Eknath Shinde To Accept Deputy CM Role In Just 20 Minutes | Inside Story Read More",

(PTI) “I am like the ocean; I will return\"— Devendra Fadnavis has often cited this line since 2019 when he was virtually robbed of the chief minister’s chair by Uddhav Thackeray, who switched camps to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi. Even in 2022, when the Mahayuti returned to power, Fadnavis had to contend with a “demotion\" to deputy CM. This got him constant taunts from Uddhav Thackeray and his party, which often described Fadnavis as being outdone by the political chakravyuh. Supriya Sule of the NCP often took potshots, saying, “What can one Fadnavis do alone?\" The 2024 Lok Sabha election debacle for the Mahayuti in Maharashtra was also laid on the door of Fadnavis, as the BJP fared badly under his leadership. It seemed to many that the Fadnavis story was over, and his competitors in the BJP believed so. related stories But in the mother of all comebacks, Fadnavis has led the BJP to its best-ever performance in Maharashtra with 132 seats at a phenomenal 85% strike rate just six months later. He has also reclaimed the CM’s chair. “Main modern Abhimanyu hun, main chakravyuh todna bhi janta hun, aur jitna bhi janta hun (I am a modern Abhimanyu who knows how to breach the chakravyuh and win),\" was the favourite poll slogan of Fadnavis during the election campaign. ALSO READ | Eknath Shinde Agrees To Deputy CM Role, But 2 Key Posts Remain Sticking Points: Sources Many in the BJP also attribute it to Fadnavis’s strategy that the Shiv Sena and NCP splits happened in Maharashtra over the past two and a half years. While Fadnavis always said these parties broke up due to their patriarchs preferring their sons or daughters over the more deserving candidates, one cannot discount the fact that the BJP leader was silently chipping away at these conflicts. Ultimately, he has humbled both Uddhav and Supriya Sule. Fadnavis is also among the handful of leaders in the BJP whom both PM Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat have a fondness for. Fadnavis always had an ace up his sleeve—the RSS. Born into a family deeply entrenched in the Sangh ideology, he began his political journey with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, which is the student wing of the RSS. His father’s strong and unwavering association with the organisation further cemented his image as a loyal swayamsevak, a factor seen as crucial and significant in navigating Maharashtra’s politically volatile and sensitive landscape. This is a relationship that Fadnavis has nurtured over the years, including seeking the RSS’s help against “vote jihad\" after the Lok Sabha results went against the BJP. Soon after the polling was over in Maharashtra, Fadnavis dutifully paid a visit to Bhagwat at the RSS headquarters to thank the RSS for its groundwork in the polls. The RSS subsequently made it clear to the BJP that Fadnavis was its choice for the CM after the BJP had secured a record 132 seats.

It was under Fadnavis’s watch as CM till 2019 that big infrastructure projects like the Samruddhi Mahamarg from Nagpur to Mumbai were envisioned and launched. Projects like the coastal road, Atal Setu, and the Metro in Mumbai also became a reality in Mahayuti 2.0. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all As one of the youngest mayors of Nagpur in 1997 and then an MLA continuously from a seat in Nagpur since 1999, Fadnavis has proven his political mettle and his hold over the key region of Vidarbha. When the crucial moment came in 2022 to make a “sacrifice\" for the sake of loyalty towards his party discipline, Fadnavis slipped into the deputy CM role without any complaints and waited for his turn. This was something that has endeared Fadnavis even more to PM Modi. In the entire election campaign, and even after the big win, Fadnavis did not lay claim to the CM’s chair and left it to the Prime Minister.

The liberation of the city has been successfully carried out, and the situation is under control,” the M23 spokesperson, Lawrence Kanyuka, said on X . It was not clear on Monday morning how much of Goma, the capital of North Kivu state in eastern DRC, was controlled by the rebels, but witnesses in the city said rebel fighters could be seen in the centre. Residents said gunfire could be heard near the airport, city centre and near the border with Rwanda . The rebels had ordered government soldiers to surrender by 3am on Monday (0100 GMT) and 100 Congolese soldiers had handed over their weapons to Uruguayan troops in the UN peacekeeping mission in DRC (Monusco), Uruguay’s military said. Monusco staff and their families were evacuating across the border to Rwanda on Monday morning, where 10 buses were waiting to pick them up. map The eastern borderlands of DRC are a tinderbox of rebel and militia fiefdoms stemming from two regional wars after Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, when Hutu extremists murdered close to 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. M23 is the latest in a long line of Tutsi-led rebel movements. On Sunday, the UN special representative Bintou Keita told the UN security council that despite peacekeepers’ support for the Congolese armed forces, M23 and Rwandan forces had entered the Munigi neighbourhood on Goma’s outskirts, “causing mass panic”. Keita said M23 fighters were advancing and using residents “as human shields” as others fled for their lives. DRC’s foreign minister, Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, told the security council that Rwanda was committing “a frontal aggression, a declaration of war which no longer hides itself behind diplomatic manoeuvres”. Rwanda’s ambassador to the UN, Ernest Rwamucyo, did not confirm or deny DRC’s claims. He blamed the country’s government, saying the crisis could have been averted if it had “demonstrated a genuine commitment to peace”. M23 says it exists to protect the ethnic Tutsi population in DRC. The rebels briefly took over Goma in 2012 , withdrawing after international donors cut aid to Rwanda over its support for the group. They resurfaced in late 2021, with increasing support from Rwanda. M23’s offensive risks worsening one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. More than one-third of the population of North Kivu state are displaced, according to the UN.

A dossier of evidence compiled by two humanitarian organisations , seen by the Guardian, contains photos, testimonies and geolocations allegedly showing the authorities’ failure to save the boys, who called for help as they struggled cold and lost in the forests of Burgas, in south-eastern Bulgaria. The organisations, No Name Kitchen (NNK) and Collettivo Rotte Balcaniche (CRB), say their report, Frozen Lives, reveals a bigger picture of brutality against migrants at Europe’s borders. Bulgaria’s border with Turkey is a frequent crossing point for people hoping to claim asylum in Europe but there have been well-documented human rights abuses in recent years, including allegations of illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers to Turkey . It is forbidding terrain, rocky and hilly with freezing winter temperatures and bitter winds. NNK and CRB say they were first alerted on the morning of 27 December 2024 that calls had been made to an emergency hotline set up by an umbrella group of charities. The calls referred to three teenagers “at immediate risk of death” and sent GPS locations. The activists then made multiple calls to the official 112 emergency number and attempted to reach the boys themselves. View image in fullscreen The body of Seifalla Elbeltagy was found on 29 December 2024, after the temperature in Burgas fell below freezing, with biting winds intensifying the cold. Photograph: NNK & CRB Bulgarian border police allegedly hindered rescue attempts from the organisations despite being shown a video of one of the boys in the snow. The boys, later identified as Ahmed Samra, 17, Ahmed Elawdan, 16, and 15-year-old Seifalla Elbeltagy , were all later found dead with Ahmed Samra discovered with “dog paw prints and boot prints around his body”, which, the report says, “indicates that the border police had already found him, maybe still alive or dead, but had chosen to leave him there in the cold”. Activists returning to the scene later say they found that all traces of the prints had been erased. One of those who discovered the body in the snow said the image was forever “burned” into their memory. One of the boys’ bodies was discovered to have been partly eaten by an animal. The report details systematic harassment of the organisations’ rescue teams in plummeting temperatures in December, as well as vandalism of one of their cars, which they had been forced to abandon by border guards and was later found with its windows smashed and screws in its engine to disable it.

Photograph: N Doychinov/AFP/Getty One rescue team had their passports and phones confiscated by police, and their fingerprints and photographs taken. A female activist was strip-searched at the police station. “I was separated from my male friends and strip-searched in front of two border police officers and was made to sit there while they went through my bags,” she said. “I was on my period and it felt deeply uncomfortable and unnecessary to make me stand there naked. It felt like every action the officers made was just to intimidate and scare us and put us off doing something similar again.” During another rescue attempt, one group was forced to walk about six miles (10km) to the nearest town while being followed by border police in their car.

Photograph: Planet Labs PBC/AP Sudan Scores killed in hospital attack in Sudan’s besieged El Fasher, says WHO About 70 people, including patients, believed to have been killed in attack blamed on rebel Rapid Support Forces Associated Press Sun 26 Jan 2025 09.45 GMT Last modified on Sun 26 Jan 2025 19.19 GMT Share About 70 people have been killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan, the head of the World Health Organization has said, the latest in a series of attacks as the African nation’s civil war has escalated in recent days. The attack on the Saudi teaching maternal hospital was blamed by local officials on the rebel Rapid Support Forces, a group that has recently faced apparent battlefield losses to the Sudanese military and allied forces under the command of army chief Gen Abdel-Fattah Burhan. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry denounced the attack as “a violation of international law”. International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a US assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and sanctions targeting Burhan, have not halted the fighting. map v3 “The appalling attack on Saudi hospital in El Fasher, Sudan, led to 19 injuries and 70 deaths among patients and companions,” the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, wrote on X on Sunday. “At the time of the attack, the hospital was packed with patients receiving care.” Another health facility in Al Malha also was attacked on Saturday, he added. “We continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,” he wrote. “Above all, Sudan’s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.” Tedros did not say who had launched the attack, though local officials had blamed the RSF for the assault. Clementine Nkweta-Salami, a UN official who coordinates humanitarian efforts in Sudan, warned on Thursday that the RSF had given “a 48-hour ultimatum to forces allied to the Sudanese Armed Forces to vacate the city and indicated a forthcoming offensive”. “Since May 2024, El Fasher has been under RSF siege,” she said. “Civilians in El Fasher have already endured months of suffering, violence and gross human rights abuses under the prolonged siege. Their lives now hang in the balance due to an increasingly precarious situation.” ‘In El Fasher you face only death’: Sudan city empties as paramilitaries close in Read more The RSF did not immediately acknowledge the attack in El Fasher, which is more than 800km (500 miles) south-west of Khartoum. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the war. The RSF siege had killed 782 civilians and wounded more than 1,140 others, the UN said in December, warning the true figures were likely to be higher. The Saudi hospital, just north of El Fasher’s airport, is near the frontlines of the war and has been repeatedly hit by shelling. Its doctors continue carrying out surgeries, sometimes by the light of mobile phones while the hospital is hit. However, the RSF appeared in recent days to have lost control of the Khartoum refinery, the biggest in Sudan and crucial to its economy and that of South Sudan. Burhan’s forces also say they broke a RSF siege of the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum. The rebels claimed they were “tightening the noose” around that base. Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021. Bashir faces charges at the international criminal court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the UN say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war. The RSF and Sudan’s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war. Explore more on these topics Sudan Africa Middle East and north Africa Saudi Arabia news Share Reuse this content",

In a statement released on Friday, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria said that a Boeing 787-800 belonging to United Airlines was forced to make an emergency return last Friday. The plane departed from Murtala Muhammed international airport in Lagos at 11.59pm on 23 January and made the emergency return and landed safely at 3.22am on 24 January. According to United Airlines, the plane made the emergency return due to a “technical issue and an unexpected aircraft movement”, USA Today reports . On board the flight were 245 passengers, 11 crew members and three pilots. While all passengers and crew were able to disembark safely following the emergency landing, four passengers and two crew members sustained serious injuries, Faan said, adding an additional 27 passengers and five crew members had minor injuries. Micheal Achimugu, Nigeria’s director of public affairs and consumer protection at the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), confirmed the incident to Nigeria’s state-run media outlet Radio Nigeria and reassured the public that there had been no fatalities. Those with minor injuries received first aid and were discharged immediately, according to Faan. Meanwhile, those with serious injuries were stabilized and transferred to the Duchess hospital in Ikeja, the capital city of Lagos state.

Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) soldiers are believed to have secretly crossed into the eastern DRC over the past few days to assist a lightning offensive by the M23 militia . Officials speaking to the Observer on condition of anonymity said the RDF had cranked up the pressure on the Congolese city by massing troops on the Rwandan side of the border, a few hundred metres from central Goma. Most of the RDF’s most senior commanders are said to have been deployed in the Rwandan city of Gisenyi, less than a mile across the border from Goma. “The Rwandan army is lined up at the border, ready to invade,” said a source who has knowledge of the RDF and is privy to real-time intelligence. Fierce skirmishes between M23 advance units and the Congolese army were reported on the outskirts of Goma throughout Saturday. Thirteen UN peacekeepers were killed in fighting, nine from South African peacekeepers, three from the Malawi Defence Forces and a Uruguayan member of the UN force who was killed while four others were wounded. The frontline appears to be moving ever closer to Goma’s outskirts, with one source saying the fighting was almost within the city limits, having bypassed the vast refugee camps that hold more than a million people displaced by the fighting. A major offensive by the Rwandan-backed M23 was foiled overnight, Congolese army sources said. “Goma’s defences are just about holding out, but they [Rwanda] want to take Goma before the UNSC [UN security council],” said a senior intelligence source, requesting anonymity. View image in fullscreen A street scene in Goma on Friday. Photograph: Arlette Bashizi/Reuters Meanwhile, the DRC recalled its diplomats from Rwanda and asked Rwanda to cease diplomatic and consular activities in the Congolese capital Kinshasa, within 48 hours, according to a leaked foreign ministry letter to the Rwandan embassy. The UN security council brought forward an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss the crisis. When the M23 captured Goma in 2012, its forces rapidly withdrew when Rwanda came under intense international pressure to stop backing the militia. This time, intelligence sources believe, Rwanda wants to take control of the city before the west can summon an effective response. Such a move will rely on M23 units imminently breaching Goma’s embattled defences, routing the Congolese army and assuming control of the city of more than a million people on the northern shore of Lake Kivu. Before the recent influx of Rwandan troops, UN experts estimated that up to 4,000 RDF personnel were operating inside the DRC. Sources also warn that Rwanda will not stop at Goma and is hoping to seize the city of Bukavu, which lies close to the border at the southern tip of Lake Kivu. The M23 insurgency in the DRC’s mineral-rich east has intensified this year, with rebels seizing control of more territory. Last week they took control of Minova, a key town along one of Goma’s main supply routes. Two days later, they captured Sake, a town 12 miles from Goma and previously the army’s main defensive position against the M23. The developments threaten the supply of food and basic supplies into Goma. Speaking on Saturday to the Observer , Clémentine de Montjoye of Human Rights Watch said: “The situation is dire. Today we are hearing reports of fighting north and west of the city, as well as water and power shortages in the city. “Given the huge number of civilians seeking shelter in Goma, pressure must be mounted on all parties to protect civilians and infrastructure such as hospitals and allow access to humanitarian aid.” Many analysts are critical of the west’s response to the crisis, particularly its failure to rein in Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame. The UK, US and France – three of the five permanent members of the UN security council – are accused by critics of being too close to Kagame. In a statement on Saturday, the EU said: “Rwanda must cease its support for the M23 and withdraw.” The Rwandan government says it does not back the M23, but had not res- ponded by the time of going to press.

As with any Maga acolyte, the US-Mexico border figured prominently in his mind. “If we declare war on the cartel, these dudes are not going to understand what the fuck is going on. They are in for a world of ultra-violence,” said Hafer, who served in the Green Berets and the CIA . “JD [Vance] or Trump had said something with the new guy from Ice, like: ‘We’re going to mobilize tier one units against the cartel.’” Referring to some of the most secretive parts of the American special forces, Hafer was forecasting the next chapter in the war on drugs – actual war inside Mexico , targeting the Sinaloa, Jalisco and other major narcotics-trafficking cartels with the same famed units of the war on terror. “Yes, that is a real thing,” he said. While it sounded like a scene out of Sicario , Hafer’s video garnered several million YouTube views . It raises the question: what would that type of combat south of the border actually cost the US? Now, it is a possible reality. The persistent talk of unilateral US military intervention in Mexico is dangerous John P Sullivan, Small Wars Journal-El Centro In one of Donald Trump’s first executive orders on Monday, he officially designated Mexican cartels terrorist organizations, joining the likes of al-Qaida and the Islamic State (Isis) – chief adversaries in more than two decades of expensive and bloody American wars. Days later, the Pentagon followed up and announced the deployment of 1,500 active-duty troops to the border. But experts say any American incursion into Mexico could come with serious repercussions and blowback. Mexican drug cartels, well-armed from the heavy flow of US weapons , unhesitatingly employ retaliatory violence, and regular Americans could be caught in the crossfire – namely, tourists in vacation hot spots like Cancun, where cartel networks are already well-defined, or the many communities on the border with Mexico. “The persistent talk of unilateral US military intervention in Mexico is dangerous,” said John P Sullivan, a former law enforcement officer in Los Angeles and a senior fellow at the Small Wars Journal-El Centro . Sullivan said that, from a legal standpoint, the special designation does not expressly direct military actions, but he noted that calling out “cartel actions and immigration as an invasion is likely a deliberate choice to allow direct military action”. Cartels may retaliate by hitting soft targets such as tourists or diplomatic targets in Mexico Lucas Webber, Tech Against Terrorism The types of operations Hafer and Trump – who warned reporters that special forces on Mexican soil “could happen” – were describing are the same as past missions against Isis and al-Qaida . With both groups, a mixture of elite units – such as Seal Team 6 with the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden inside Pakistan – and aerial strikes were used to pursue every level of middle- to high-ranking operative. US intelligence compiled the so-called “ kill lists ” of targets, and the US Special Operations Command (Socom) mostly went about ticking them off that list. The cost was in the billions of dollars and civilian deaths were commonplace, creating a legion of new recruits that drove the very rise of Isis itself. “While targeting cartel leadership in ‘kingpin’ operations is politically attractive, it is operationally precarious,” said Sullivan. “Often, the displacement of capos creates a leadership vacuum, triggering infighting among cartel factions vying to replace the last leader, resulting in an elevated state of violence and insecurity in the resulting quest for power and competitive control.” At least for now, a Socom contingent will not be part of Trump’s first deployment of soldiers to the southern border. “There are no SOCOM troops being deployed in support of this effort,” said a public affairs officer at Socom in a statement to the Guardian. Previously, Barack Obama as well as Trump had toyed with designating the cartels as terrorist groups, but reneged. In 2020, however, Trump still suggested missile strikes inside Mexico . Declaring total war on Mexican cartels would also implicate the very fabric of that country: narcotics trafficking is widely believed to be one of the top employers in Mexico and contributes billions to its economy annually .

Photograph: Mario Caicedo/EPA Colombia Rebels passed through Venezuela en route to Colombia before deadly attack, report reveals Leaked report raises likelihood that Venezuelan government green-lit attack that killed more than 80 Luke Taylor in Bogotá Mon 27 Jan 2025 11.00 GMT Share Tensions are growing between Bogotá and Caracas after it emerged that rebels responsible for one of Colombia ’s worst episodes of violence in recent years travelled through Venezuelan territory before launching the bloody wave of attacks. At least 80 combatants armed with assault rifles and explosives passed through the Venezuelan border states of Táchira and Zulia before attacking a rival armed group and its suspected civilian supporters, according to a leaked military intelligence report. Diplomatic tensions between the two neighbouring countries are likely to worsen because of the likelihood that the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro either green-lit the operation or played an active role in planning the assault, analysts said. “We do not have hard evidence, but it’s difficult to believe it’s a coincidence that the conflict erupted [when it did] due to the timing with the Maduro and Trump inaugurations,” said Bram Ebus, an analyst at the International Crisis Group. The National Liberation Army (ELN) launched its attack on a rival rebel faction last Thursday as it sought to purge the lawless Catatumbo region of competitors. At least 80 have been killed and 40,000 displaced by the violence. The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, responded by breaking off peace negotiations with the ELN, announcing an “internal state of commotion” and deploying troops to the border. His Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolás Maduro, also sent troops to the border. But as the scale of the human rights atrocity became clear, tensions ratcheted up further as Petro questioned how it was possible that so many armed men could have travelled hundreds of miles from Arauca to Norte de Santander undetected. “Surely we would have some form of information and we did not have it. Where did they walk through?” Petro asked pointedly. Caracas has hit back accusing Petro – a former leftwing guerrilla himself – of betraying his roots. “That man is a zombie; he has ruined all his prestige. There is nothing left of the leftwing person he once was,” a high-ranking official in the Maduro administration told the Spanish newspaper El País. The ELN, the world’s oldest active guerrilla group, has been known to operate in Venezuelan territory for decades. Rights groups and analysts say that, as Venezuela has collapsed into a social and political crisis that has forced 7 million of its citizens to flee, the ELN’s presence in the country has grown stronger and its bonds with the government tighter. Initially allowed to operate in exchange for a share of profits, the rebel group has since become an extension of the Venezuelan state, experts say. Rights groups say that Venezuelan forces have worked with the ELN on several occasions in recent years to eradicate rival guerrilla groups. The ELN is also reportedly used by Maduro to control the flow of people and goods across the border region and enforce order in a region known as the mining arc, where the rebels exploit rich deposits of gold, diamonds and coltan. Venezuela’s mining arc: a legal veneer for armed groups to plunder Read more “It’s not just that the government is turning a blind eye. They are partners,” says Cristina Burelli, founder of SOS Orinoco, an environmental advocacy group. Maduro’s ties to the ELN have long been an open and uncomfortable secret but the humanitarian catastrophe in Catatumbo has cast a spotlight on Maduro’s relationship with the rebel group and put pressure on Petro to take action. “What Venezuela is doing is making a mockery of Colombia and we are allowing it,” retired military general Gustavo Matamoros Camacho told local radio on Thursday. Petro was one of Maduro’s few remaining allies but refused to attend his inauguration on 10 January after Venezuela’s national elections were widely deemed a sham. “Petro is trying to be delicate, but for Maduro, this is an affront. It means war to him,” Burelli said, “Two weeks after his inauguration, and all hell breaks loose? The timing is too close.” Maduro denies that Venezuela is a safe haven for the ELN and has hit back at Colombia, accusing it of hosting the Venezuelan crime syndicate Tren de Aragua. Petro must now walk the tightrope of managing the security threat at the border and Venezuela’s alleged involvement in it while avoiding further antagonising Caracas. Petro said on Thursday that he was in dialogue with its neighbours and has asked “the person who runs the presidency in Venezuela” to block illegal border crossings. Colombia’s fore...",

But four days into Donald Trump’s second administration, here we are. Trump has declared that he is “ taking back ” the Panama canal, sending TV crews from Washington to Beijing scrambling here to cover a crisis that has led to frenzied diplomatic efforts and elicited fears of a repeat of the 1989 US military invasion. Never mind that there are no signs of the Chinese influence Trump claims dominates this waterway, and the canal’s administrators deny his accusations that they overcharge US ships. Panama may have the truth on its side – the question is whether that counts for much these days. “What I say is: come and see it,” said Ilya Espino de Marotta, the Panama canal’s deputy administrator, when asked in the control tower about Trump’s remarks. “It’s pretty obvious when you come to the canal. We’re a very transparent entity.” Panama Canal US secretary of state Marco Rubio may do just that this week as he descends on Latin America for his first tour abroad. According to Espino de Marotta, he is already discussing a meeting with the canal’s leadership. “I understand he’s going to meet with the administrator of the canal, so hopefully this would be a good place to meet,” she told the Observer , adding that she couldn’t speak for Rubio’s official agenda. On visiting the canal, she said: “I hope they are.” Rubio’s potential visit to the canal zone – which would come as part of a week-long swing through Central America that will also include Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic – has not been previously reported. The Observer has approached the state department for comment. “The canal is run by Panamanians 100%. We are an autonomous entity,” added Espino de Marotta, who began working for the canal in the shipyard in 1985, when it was still under US control, and rose to lead its ambitious expansion. “There is no Chinese management of the canal.” Speaking with current and former officials in Panama, as well as analysts, activists and rights watchdogs, it’s clear this country of just 4.5 million people at the southernmost tip of Central America is holding its breath as it tries to figure out what Trump wants and how far he is willing to go to get it. He has said he will not rule out military force to take the canal – or annexing Greenland. The Financial Times on Friday reported that he held a “fiery” phone call with the Danish prime minister over US claims on Greenland that, according to five European sources, went “very badly”. Denmark is now in “crisis mode”. In Panama, a country with a dollarised economy and a recent familiarity with American imperialism , the muggy air is thick with risk management. Few expect a military campaign, but economic coercion is a real threat for this country. Yet the claims that the canal is mismanaged have touched a nerve. Just days after Trump first issued his threats over the canal, three former leaders of the country convened with President José Raúl Mulino in a rare show of support in Panama’s fractured politics. “I know you know that some people don’t care about facts, but they’re there,” Martín Torrijos, the president of Panama from 2004-09 and the initiator of the expansion project, said in an interview with the Observer from his offices overlooking Panama Bay. View image in fullscreen Former Panama president Martin Torrijos, in front of a portrait of his father, in his Panama City office. Photograph: Tito Herrera/the Observer In 1977, his father, the strongman Gen Omar Torrijos, signed the two treaties with Jimmy Carter that would eventually cede control of the canal to Panama by 1999. Last month, Torrijos attended Carter’s funeral, where he said that old US opponents of the handover told him it had been the right decision all along. (At the time, it was extremely divisive. Ronald Reagan’s take was: “We built it, we paid for it, it’s ours.” Within a decade, the US would invade the country to overthrow the dictator Manuel Noriega .) But the days when the US could overthrow a Panamanian government had passed, said Torrijos, and a military intervention against the canal, much less the country, was not realistic. “The times where the US had a military presence in Panama – that f...",

Photograph: Justin Tang/AP Canada Ontario premier Doug Ford to call snap election to fight Trump tariff threat Progressive Conservative leader of Canada’s most populous province seeks ‘strong mandate’ to counter 25% tariff plan Leyland Cecco in Toronto Fri 24 Jan 2025 19.41 GMT First published on Fri 24 Jan 2025 17.10 GMT Share The Ontario premier, Doug Ford, has said an early election is needed in the Canadian province in order to fend off an income “attack” from Donald Trump as a trade war looms between the close allies. But opposition parties criticized the move, calling it a “distraction” from an ongoing criminal investigation into the government’s handling of a controversial multibillion-dollar land swap. Ford, 60, ended months of speculation on Friday, telling reporters that he planned to meet province’s lieutenant governor early next week to dissolve his government and call an election which will take place on 27 February. He is seeking a third consecutive majority government for his right-of-center Progressive Conservatives. Ford previously won substantial electoral victories in 2022 and 2018 and said he wants to win “the largest mandate in Ontario’s history” in the February vote. Ontario leader warns of ‘pain’ for US if Trump imposes tariffs on Canada Read more Ontario, the country’s most populous province and its C$1.1tn economy is home to the manufacturing heartland. Experts believe Ontario would be badly hit if the new US president goes ahead with a threat to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports on 1 February. “The attack is coming against our families, our businesses, our communities, and with a strong mandate, we will be able to fight with Donald Trump,” Ford told reporters on Friday. He also decried a “lack of leadership at the federal level”, adding: “ we don’t know who is going to be the next prime minister ” following Justin Trudeau’s resignation earlier this month. Ford has emerged as one of the strongest voices against the expected tariffs and in recent weeks has been a frequent guest on US television shows. He has also floated the prospect of cutting off power supplies to the US and banning US alcohol products if necessary , staking out a position starkly different from other conservative premiers in the country. “The premier is likely thinking that if the tariffs come to pass, they’re going to have a real serious economic impact. Any retaliation by Canada is going to be very controversial and will have economic pains of its own,” said Randy Besco, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “And voters usually punish governments when the economy is bad, even if the government isn’t responsible. So they might suspect things could be bad a year from now. Right now, they feel they’re doing pretty well and can run on that.” But the premier’s political rivals have been critical of the decision, saying there is unified support in the province for a strong response to the tariffs. While Ford has indicated he will make the election about tariffs, opposition parties will probably shift the conversation towards what they say is a government embroiled in “corrupt” dealings and overreaching with controversial policies . Ontario’s Liberal leader, Bonnie Crombie, accused the premier of choosing “recklessness over responsibility” in a video message posted to social media. “[Ford is] answering chaos by creating more chaos at a time where we need stability and certainty,” she said. “This election shows us that the only job he’s interested in protecting is his own.” The New Democratic party leader said Ford had called the election as a way for Ford to “distract from the RCMP’s criminal investigation into his government”. In October 2023, federal police said they had opened a criminal investigation into a controversial plan to allow construction on greenbelt lands in Ontario, escalating a political scandal that has gripped the province and forced a number of high-profile government resignations. But both parties are polling far behind Ford’s Progressive Conservatives. “All the reasons that Ford wants an election is exactly the reasons opposition parties don’t want to have one,” said Besco.

Unveiling the new design of the bank notes late on Thursday, the governor of Belize’s central bank, Kareem Michael, said that along with improved security and anti-counterfeit features, the “new family of notes also allows us to recognize and celebrate our heritage and the rich history of Belize”. The new notes will go into circulation in June. Instead of the queen’s image, the new 100-, 20- and five-dollar bills will feature George Cadle Price, who was the first prime minister of the Central American country and is considered the father of independence from British rule. Fifty-, 10- and two-dollar bills will bear the likeness of Philip Goldson, a founding member of the country’s major political parties, the People’s United party and the United Democratic party , who is celebrated as a champion of national pride. View image in fullscreen Queen Elizabeth II’s image on Belizean bank notes will be replaced with George Cadle Price’s. Photograph: Aurore Shirley/Alamy Belize’s prime minister, Johnny Briceño, said the new images “exemplify our national heroes who symbolize our resistance”. Speaking to local media he said: “I know some people will say, ‘We don’t have the queen [on the note].’ Well, the queen has died, and that has nothing to do with the Belize dollar. “While the primary reason for this change was to incorporate technological advancements into new notes for increased security features and durability, it is one more way for us to remember the sacrifices of those who came before us. Each time we look at the faces of our national heroes on our new currency, we are seeing history, we are seeing leadership, we are seeing the great work that led us to where we are today,” Briceño said.. There was a mixed public reaction to the new notes, with some questioning the need to redesign and others expressing concern about the impact on the value of the Belize dollar. But for those campaigning for Belize to remove King Charles as head of state, the removal of the British monarch from the country’s money is an important milestone in the journey towards becoming a republic. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Long Wave Free weekly newsletter Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “I have long argued that symbolic changes – such as renaming streets, putting national heroes on currency and replacing the king with a Belizean head of state – are needed but in no way enough. Constitutional and political reforms are essential for more meaningful decolonisation – for example, separation of legislative and executive powers, and reforming the electoral system to include proportional representation. “The hopeful angle is that when the new currency notes have no impact on their lives, other than increasing national pride, fewer Belizeans will fear the more substantive move of replacing the British monarch with a Belizean head of state as part of wider constitutional decolonisation and reform.” Explore more on these topics Belize Colonialism Queen Elizabeth II Americas news Share Reuse this content",

Scientists have long been divided over whether the fungus-like pathogen Phtytophthora infestans cropped up in the Andes or originated in Mexico . Now one team of researchers say the question is settled after conducting what they describe as one of the largest whole genome studies of the microbe and its close relatives – with the results supporting a South American origin. “This is how science works. There’s a hypothesis, people question it, test it, present data,” said Prof Jean Ristaino, the co-author of the research from North Carolina State University. “But over time, the evidence is really weighted in favour of the Andes, because the DNA doesn’t lie, the genetics show ancestry in that region.” She added that the conclusion tallied with historical documents. “In 1845 when this blight hit Europe and the US immediately they were trying to figure out where it came from,” Ristaino said. “And there were reports that the disease had occurred and was known among the indigenous Andean Indians that grew potatoes.” Ristaino did not rule out further debate but said the amount of data available would be difficult to counter. View image in fullscreen Famine Memorial sculptures by Rowan Gillespie in Dublin Photograph: Radharc Images/Alamy Writing in the journal Plos One, Ristaino and colleagues report how they carried out an analysis of the microbe genomes and their close relatives from South America and Mexico , finding those from Mexico emerged more recently than the others. The team found that modern populations of the potato blight microbe have a complex relationship, suggesting those from Mexico, the Andes and Europe have mixed in recent times. But while modern populations of the microbe from the US, Mexico and South America all emerged from historic populations from the 19th century, the researchers say the Mexican populations are the most recent. “If Mexico is the centre of origin, you would expect it to be the root of the tree, and that’s not the case,” said Ristaino. Potato blight continues to pose a threat, with Ristaino noting there are fungicide resistant strains of the pathogen in Europe. “The growers are having to look at different kinds of chemicals, and companies are trying to come up with different methods,” she said. “Maybe through breeding and gene-edited potatoes there may be a longer term solution, but right now it’s globally a problem in many parts of the world including in developing countries in Africa, South America, and in England.” Ristaino said understanding where potato blight originated was important. “When you know the centre of origin of a pathogen, that’s where you’re going to find resistance to it,” she said. “In the long run, the way to manage this disease is through host resistance, and [this work shows] the focus on breeding efforts needs to happen back in the Andes.” Dr David Cooke of the James Hutton Institute, an expert on potato blight, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the research. The origins of the pathogen remain up for debate, not least because the populations in South America reproduce almost entirely asexually, in other words by producing clones, whereas in Mexico populations mostly reproduce sexually – as would be expected for a centre of origin as this process maintains diversity and helps to prevent a species accumulating bad mutations over time. “What we need as a smoking gun would be a survey in South America that reveals a sexual population,” he said.

Photograph: Kim Soo-hyeon/Reuters South Korea plane crash Bird remains found in both engines of crashed Jeju Air jet, report says Plane appears to have hit ducks before it crashed in Muan, South Korea, last month killing 179 people onboard Oliver Holmes Mon 27 Jan 2025 13.23 GMT Last modified on Mon 27 Jan 2025 13.31 GMT Share An investigation into the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil has found duck remains in both engines, according to a preliminary report, suggesting the passenger jet hit birds before slamming down on the runway. While officials have not yet determined the cause of last month’s Jeju Air crash that killed all but two of the 181 people onboard, the report released on Monday said feathers and bird bloodstains were found inside the Boeing 737-800’s engines. “The samples were sent to specialised organisations for DNA analysis and a domestic organisation identified them as belonging to Baikal teals,” said the report from South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board. Baikal teals are a type of migratory duck that fly to South Korea for winter in large numbers. The pilots made an emergency call while attempting to land and warned of a bird strike. Air crashes are usually caused by several factors and bird strikes are relatively common. The six-page report did not go beyond factual details and several questions remain, such as why the jet abandoned its first landing attempt and then turned around to land on the same runway in the opposite direction – a rare manoeuvre as pilots prefer to land into the wind, which helps with stability and braking. The jet touched down late on the runway at high speed with no landing gear deployed and no apparent use of the wing flaps, which are lowered for landing. After sliding down the runway, the plane hit a dirt and concrete embankment built to house navigation equipment and burst into flames. Investigators have been stymied by a lack of usable data from the black box recorders, which stopped recording about four minutes before the airliner exploded. Previously, this has occurred when there was an onboard electrical failure. South Korean authorities will be under pressure to avoid a repeat of the aftermath of the Sewol ferry disaster in April 2014 in which more than 300 people died, mostly high school students. Many relatives of the victims complained that it took authorities too long to identify the dead and to establish the cause of the sinking. Under global aviation guidelines, a final report is expected within a year.

Shares in companies listed in Asia and Europe fell on Monday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index in New York was poised to open lower after investors digested the implications of AI models developed by the startup DeepSeek. The DeepSeek AI assistant topped the Apple app store in the US and UK over the weekend, above OpenAI’s ChatGPT . AI prototypes for UK welfare system dropped as officials lament ‘false starts’ Read more Shares in AI-related companies based in the US such as Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta were expected to fall when US markets open. DeepSeek claims to have used fewer chips than its rivals to develop its models, making them cheaper to produce and raising questions over a multibillion-dollar AI spending spree by US companies that has boosted markets in recent years. The company developed bespoke algorithms to build its model using reduced-capability H800 chips produced by America’s Nvidia and spending less than $6m (£4.8m), according to a research paper published in December. Nvidia’s most advanced chips, H100s, have been banned from export to China since September 2022 by US sanctions. Nvidia then developed the less powerful H800 chips for the Chinese market, although they were also banned from export to China last October. DeepSeek’s success at building an advanced AI model without access to the most cutting-edge US technology has raised concerns about the efficacy of Washington’s attempts to stymie China’s hi-tech sector. Marc Andreessen, a leading US venture capitalist, compared the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model to a pivotal moment in the US-USSR space race, posting on X on Sunday that it was AI’s “Sputnik moment”. According to DeepSeek, its R1 model outperforms OpenAI’s o1-mini model across “various benchmarks”, while research by Artificial Analysis puts it above models developed by Google, Meta and Anthropic in terms of overall quality. The company was founded by the entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, who runs a hedge fund, High-Flyer Capital, that uses AI to identify patterns in stock prices. Liang reportedly started buying Nvidia chips in 2021 to develop AI models as a hobby, bankrolled by his hedge fund. In 2023, he founded DeepSeek, which is based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou. The company is purely focused on research rather than commercial products – the DeepSeek assistant and underlying code can be downloaded for free. In an interview with Chinese media, Liang said “AI should be affordable and accessible to everyone.” Liang also said that the gap between US and Chinese AI was only one to two years. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Plus, blizzard fears in Alaska Mon 27 Jan 2025 09.09 GMT Last modified on Mon 27 Jan 2025 13.49 GMT Share China was hit by snowstorms and a significant cold wave over the weekend, and the extreme conditions are expected to persist as the country approaches the new year on Wednesday. Temperatures are forecast to drop to more than 10C (18F) below the seasonal average in some areas, with northern regions experiencing the most severe weather. Maximum temperatures in Shenyang are expected to plummet by more than 13C, while Yinchuan could tumble to -8C. Snowstorms have been affecting north-western China, with accumulation reaching 8cm in some areas. Additional snowfall is expected later this week, potentially disrupting travel during the festive period. The cold wave is caused primarily by a weakening of the polar vortex, allowing cold air from the north to push farther south. This is exacerbated by a high-pressure system known as the Siberian high, which is funnelling cold and dry air from Siberia southwards, trapping it over the region and intensifying the drop in temperatures. The high pressure and associated cold air over China has extended south into Thailand, triggering a notable fall in temperatures and strong winds in the country. Northern, central and eastern Thailand – including the capital, Bangkok – have experienced temperature drops of 2-4C, with 3-5C in the north-east. According to the national meteorological department, the La Niña phenomenon is likely to bring strong south-easterly winds in the coming months. This will cause increased humidity, a higher frequency of thunderstorms and cooler-than-average temperatures. Meanwhile, Alaska was hit by extreme stormy conditions over the weekend, including heavy rain, strong winds and snow, prompting blizzard warnings. Gusts of 70mph (116km/h) lashed southern regions and heavy rainfall caused significant flooding in low-lying areas across southern and central Alaska. Avalanche warnings have been issued for several areas including Turnagain Pass, Summit Lake and Chugach state park. The combination of intense winds, heavy rain and snowfall has created unstable snow conditions, increasing the risk of avalanches. The temperature is expected to plunge by the end of the week as cold polar air returns, potentially the coldest the season.

The treaty principles bill , which was introduced to parliament by the minor coalition Act party, seeks to abandon a set of well-established principles that guide the relationship between Māori and ruling authorities in favour of its own redefined principles. ‘We’re not going away’: the man who led NZ’s biggest Māori rights march vows to fight on Read more The Act party argues that Māori have been afforded different political and legal rights and privileges compared with non-Māori because of the principles that have flowed from the Treaty of Waitangi – New Zealand’s founding document that is instrumental in upholding Māori rights. The proposal has sparked strident criticism from lawyers, academics and the public, who believe Act’s principles will weaken Māori rights and remove checks on the crown. It has prompted mass meetings of Māori leaders, and the largest ever protest on Māori rights . Sir Edward Taihakurei Durie, a former high court judge who helped established the Waitangi Tribunal – an institution set up to investigate breaches of the treaty – told the committee the bill erased 50 years of the tribunal’s work to help develop the principles. He said if the bill were to be passed, “our government would be the laughing stock of the western world, who understand how responsible states today seek to manage relationships with their Indigenous people.” Former National party treaty negotiations minister Christopher Finlayson told the parliamentary committee the bill was “misconceived”. “It endeavours to raise a number of principles that simply do not reflect the relationship between the crown and tangata whenua [people of the land],” he said. On the first day of the public hearing on Monday, Act leader David Seymour told the committee the treaty principles had led to a society of unequal rights. “Dividing people into racial groups is the definition of racism,” he said, adding it was putting New Zealand on the path towards totalitarianism. Māori tribes make rare plea to King Charles for intervention in New Zealand politics Read more Seymour was followed by dozens of speakers, including a handful who supported the bill and an overwhelming majority whohighlighted its failings. Political scientist Dr Bronwyn Hayward told the committee the party’s rhetoric was dangerous. “It is exploiting basic wedge-politics – it grows dissatisfaction and anger and that becomes incredibly hard to manage politically and extremely divisive for the country,” Hayward said. Former politician Dame Marilyn Waring warned the bill would wind back decades of progress for Māori who were disadvantaged compared with non-Māori. “Where a person or peoples have been subject to socially constructed, historic, systemic, and systematic accumulative disadvantage, equality can not be achieved through equal treatment,” she said. Indigenous politics scholar Dr Areti Metuamate said the bill was being pushed by the leader of a minority party without Māori consultation. “It’s an insult to Māori … you should be asking Māori first what they want, and then having conversations, not forcing a bill down our throats like this.” The bill has also triggered a historic response from the public, with early counts showing the justice committee has received more than 300,000 submissions – the highest number on a bill in the country’s history. The bill does not have widespread support and is likely to fail at the second reading. The committee will hear 80 hours of public oral submissions over the next month, with a report due back on 14 May.

The Foreign Office (FCDO) is drawing up plans to host the Chinese foreign minister in mid-February, according to three people briefed on the plans. The FCDO declined to comment. One source said the purpose of Wang’s visit was to hold a UK-China strategic dialogue for the first time since 2018. He is to attend the Munich security conference between 14 and 16 February, so his visit to the UK is likely to take place either before or after that. The trip is scheduled during a period of heightened political sensitivity. A local inquiry hearing about China’s controversial proposals to build a “super-embassy” in east London will take place on 11 February. China proposes to turn 20,000 sq metres (2 hectares) of land at Royal Mint Court, a historic site near the Tower of London, into the largest embassy in Europe. China bought the site in 2018, but the local council, Tower Hamlets, declined planning permission in 2022, citing security concerns and opposition from residents. The Conservative government declined to intervene . Beijing resubmitted the proposals after Labour came to power in July last year. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, raised the issue directly with the prime minister, Keir Starmer, in their first call, demonstrating that the stalled project has become a significant issue in China-UK relationsa. Lammy and the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, have written to Tower Hamlets signalling support for the plans. The Metropolitan police has dropped an objection it lodged with the council two months ago. The Met had warned that the embassy would be a prime target for large protests that could put the public at risk. The Chinese government is blocking the redevelopment of the British embassy in Beijing until its proposals in London are approved. The decision rests with Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary. The last UK-China strategic dialogue was held between Wang and the then British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, in 2018 . It is one of several bilateral dialogues put on ice during the coronavirus pandemic amid deteriorating relations with Beijing, and which are now being resumed by Labour ministers. Wang and Lammy met in Laos in July and again in October when the latter travelled to Beijing. Officials are drawing up plans for the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, to visit China later this year and resume the UK-China Joint economic and trade commission, a set of trade talks that last took place in 2018. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, visited Beijing and Shanghai this month to resume the UK-China economic and financial dialogue. She told reporters that the UK “must engage confidently with China” and find areas for cooperation in the national interest.

The charges are unprecedented for a South Korean president, and if convicted, Yoon could face years in prison for his shock martial law decree, which sought to ban political and parliamentary activity and control the media. His move set off a wave of political upheaval in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, a top US ally, with the prime minister also impeached and suspended from power and a number of top military officials indicted for their roles in the alleged insurrection. The prosecutors’ office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The indictment was also reported by South Korean media. Anti-corruption investigators last week recommended charging the jailed Yoon, who was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties on 14 December. Ladders, noodle stations and K-pop: how the arrest of South Korea’s president unfolded Read more A former top prosecutor himself, Yoon has been in solitary confinement since 15 January, when he become the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested , after days of defiant, armed standoff between his security detail and arresting officials. Over the weekend a court twice refused prosecutors’ request to extend his detention while they conducted further investigations, but with the charges they had again requested that he be kept in custody, media reports said. Yoon’s lawyers had urged the prosecutors to release him immediately from what they called illegal custody. Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades. “The prosecution has decided to indict Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing charges of being a ringleader of insurrection,” the Democratic party spokesperson, Han Min-soo, told a press conference. “The punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally.” Yoon and his lawyers argued at a constitutional court hearing last week in his impeachment trial that he had never intended to fully impose martial law, and meant the measures only as a warning to break political deadlock. In parallel with his criminal process, the top court will determine whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate his presidential powers, with 180 days to decide. South Korea’s opposition-led parliament impeached Yoon on 14 December, making him the second conservative president to be impeached in the country. Yoon rescinded his martial law after about six hours after lawmakers – confronting soldiers in parliament – voted down the decree. Soldiers equipped with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment were seen entering the parliament building through smashed windows during the dramatic confrontation. If Yoon were removed from office, a presidential election would be held within 60 days. Explore more on these topics Yoon Suk Yeol South Korea Asia Pacific news Share Reuse this content",

Christine Hack, the manager of Cronulla and National Park Ferry Cruises, which manages the Cronulla ferry, said the whale began following the vessel as it approached Bundeena wharf at about 10am on Monday. She said her staff, Jamie and Steve, captured footage of the whale swimming alongside the wharf and the boat, which connects Cronulla with the national park community of Bundeena, across Port Hacking. The whale followed the ferry into the wharf and then back out again, she said, adding that the sighting was “very rare”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “I’ve been here for 20 years and I’ve never heard of [a whale] being in the Hacking like that,” she said. “We see lots of dolphins, they love to swim along the bow.” The wildlife scientist Dr Vanessa Pirotta of Macquarie University said she and other scientists had identified the creature as likely to be a juvenile Antarctic minke and that spotting one in Sydney’s warm waters was “very unusual”. Dwarf minke whales, seen off Sydney during the whale migration season from May to November, were common, she said, but “this sighting is unusual, because not only is it not a dwarf, is an Antarctic minke”. “I’ve never heard of an Antarctic minke whale here,” she said. “It’s a species that we don’t generally see off Sydney, regardless of time of the year.” While the species was known to have a range from Antarctica to the north of Queensland, she said it was primarily observed in the icy waters of the Antarctic. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What brought the whale into Sydney’s shallows was not clear and she encouraged members of the public to share sightings of unusual marine species with NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service to aid scientists. “It may be a case of mis-navigation, it may be a case that it just happened to be in the area,” she said. “The good thing is it looks in good condition, and it was observed going out to [sea], which is a good thing.

Here’s what’s been keeping us busy: Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton released Holocaust memorial statements , referencing the spate of antisemitic incidents in Australia and around the world. The leader of the opposition said that a “safety crisis” was engulfing Australia and that extremist attacks had no place in the country. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, denounced the Coalition for what he said were “grotesque” attempts to politicise the Holocaust or antisemitism. Police arrested a 43-year-old man in connection with the vandalism of the NSW Police Wall of Remembrance in central Sydney. The Bureau of Meteorology is monitoring two weather systems off the coast of Queensland that have the potential to become tropical cyclones. Agencies also warned of immediate fire risk as strong winds and high temperatures collided in parts of Victoria and inland NSW. The prime minister said Grace Tame ’s “Fuck Murdoch” T-shirt was disrespectful – and was designed to get attention. He also said Sussan Ley ’s remarks comparing the arrival of the First Fleet with the colonisation of Mars were “very strange” . Thank you for joining us this Australia Day public holiday – we’ll be back with our rolling news coverage bright and early tomorrow. Share Updated at 08.55 GMT",

On Monday Melbourne was forecast to hit 41C before a late cool change. Sydney was due for 31C, Brisbane 30C, Adelaide 35C, Perth 32C and Hobart 32C. If Melbourne temperatures climbed above 40C, it would be the city’s hottest January day in five years, according to Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury. “The last time we had a 40 degree plus day in Melbourne was back in February 2023. And the last time we had a 40C day in January, we have to go all the way back to 2020.” The city was 39.8C at 3.55pm. Intensely hot, dry and windy weather had combined to cause extreme fire dangers for western and central Victoria and much of eastern South Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The Bureau of Meteorology has warned of low to severe heatwave conditions for much of the country including Western Australia, the Northern Territory, western Queensland and New South Wales . “We’re going to see temperatures for many of our inland areas get in the high 30s to low 40s, and that heat will get down to the Sydney area on Tuesday with temperatures in the mid-30s,” senior meterorologist Dean Narramore said. Jannik Sinner playing different tune to everyone else in dismantling of Zverev Read more “We could see temperatures get into the high 30s for Adelaide before a cool change, but much of Victoria is likely to see low 40s … and could even see mid-40s along the Murray.” Birdsville, in western Queensland and Moomba in north-east South Australia were expected to see some of the highest temperatures in the country on Monday, with both expected to reach the mid 40s. Birdsville had already recorded 45.2C at 1.27pm. A gusty cool change had reached the Adelaide metropolitan area around late morning and was expected to hit Victoria on Monday afternoon, with thunderstorms forecast for NSW on Tuesday. In Victoria, thunderstorms and dry lightning were a risk, as the change moved through. A total fire ban has been declared on Monday for the Wimmera, Mallee, south-west, central and north central regions of Victoria as temperatures are forecast to reach the high 30s to mid-40s, with gusty winds of 70km/h to 80km/h. The Country Fire Authority chief officer, Jason Heffernan, said the conditions would make it difficult for firefighters to suppress any blazes that started. “We’re asking people to follow the strict conditions associated with the total fire ban declaration,” he said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A total fire ban was also in place for several fire districts in South Australia, including lower and upper south-east, Murraylands, Riverland, mid north and Mount Lofty Ranges.

But Ley is standing by the comparison as her office accuses the prime minister of lacking the “imagination” to understand Australia’s founding story. The prime minister said on Monday that the analogy Ley made in her Australia Day address was “very strange”. “I thought when someone said that to me yesterday they were making it up,” Albanese said of Ley’s comments, which were part of an Australian Day speech to a church service in Albury. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “There aren’t people that we know of in Mars,” Albanese said. “Australia was not terra nullius when Captain [Arthur] Phillip and the first fleet came through Sydney Cove.” Ley had said in her speech that citizens should be proud of 26 January and denied that the first fleet had arrived “as invaders”. “In what could be compared to Elon Musk’s SpaceX’s efforts to build a new colony on Mars, men in boats arrived on the edge of the known world to embark on that new experiment,” she said. “And just like astronauts arriving on Mars, those first settlers would be confronted with a different and strange world, full of danger, adventure and potential. From that moment our national story stood at a crossroads.” But Albanese said it was a “very strange analogy to draw, and one that was disrespectful of the fact that there were people here”. From Doge to Smoge, Peter Dutton’s Coalition is an eerie echo of Trump (and Musk’s) America Read more “First Nations people [were] here for tens of thousands [of years and] we have a great privilege of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous culture on Earth,” the prime minister said. Ley was on Monday defending the analogy, which Guardian Australia understands was a reference to the historical significance of the first fleet rather than an attempt to overlook Indigenous Australians. “It is not surprising to see Anthony Albanese lacks the imagination to understand the significance of Australia’s founding story,” Ley’s spokesperson said in a statement. “This is the problem when you have a prime minister who was an activist at university instead of a student – he may see Australia’s founding as an invasion story, but I do not.” Gallagher, the finance minister, said the comparison drawn by Ley was “nuts”. “[It] took me a while to understand what she was trying to say there. But, you know, I’ll leave that to Sussan Ley to explain,” she told reporters on Monday. Ley’s speech came a day after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, added a new government efficiency portfolio to his shadow ministry, a role that drew immediate comparisons with the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in Donald Trump’s new US administration.

Court Services Victoria said that staff had discretion to order the removal of the garments, which are often worn by people expressing support for Palestine , under a law which allowed them to “ensure, maintain, or restore the security, good order and management of court premises”. The keffiyehs were worn by several of the dozens of people accused of committing offences during the protests against the Land Forces weapons expo in September, and their supporters, during hearings at the Melbourne magistrates court on 21 January. Ultra-processed food? Forever chemicals? Declining birth rates? What’s behind rising cancer in the under-50s? Read more Those charged face a wide range of offences, including assaulting or hindering police. A Court Services Victoria spokesperson said that three people wearing keffiyehs were directed to remove them, and a person wearing a T-shirt with a political statement was asked to turn it inside out. “The Keffiyehs scarves were properly receipted and returned to the court users on exit,” the spokesperson said. “Court Security Officers are authorised to exercise discretion under Court Services Victoria’s Conditions of Entry Policy.” The court spokesperson declined to comment on whether there was a specific directive banning the keffiyeh in Victorian courts, and whether the state’s chief magistrate, Justice Lisa Hannan, supported security ordering the removal of the garments. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The lawyer Bernadette Zaydan, who was representing several of the accused at the court on 21 January, said that far more than three people were asked to remove their keffiyehs, saying the number was more than a dozen. She said she witnessed the security staff, employed by G4S, ordering people to remove them, and questioned them about the directive. Victoria police have charged or fined more than 100 people in relation to the Land Forces protests. Many of those involved in the protest wore keffiyehs, and specifically opposed the weapons expo going ahead in Melbourne in the context of the ongoing Gaza conflict. Security officers ordered the removal of the keffiyehs at the public entrance to the court building.

Court Services Victoria justified the directive under the Court Security Act. The relevant sections of the act say an authorised officer can give a reasonable direction to “ensure, maintain, or restore the security, good order and management of court premises” and that they “may refuse a person entry to the court premises … if the authorized person believes on reasonable grounds that the person is likely to affect adversely the security, good order or management of the court premises”. It comes after Victoria’s parliament ruled that keffiyehs were political in May last year, effectively banning them from the upper and lower houses. The president of the upper house, Shaun Leane, told the Greens MP Samantha Ratnam at the time that watermelon earrings, another symbol of Palestinian resistance, could not be worn. He said that unlike pins worn by MPs to mark events such as Anzac Day and the Cancer Council’s Daffodil Day, there was no “consensus” around the Palestinian symbols. “If it is a cause we can all get behind or we reasonably think everybody can get behind, we should be relaxed about it,” Leane said. “If it is symbolism – and I am not making a commentary o...",

The woman and the boy shared “loose family connections” and her own children were present at the time of the alleged killing, Det Sen Sgt Dave Miles told media in the north Queensland city on Monday morning. The boy was dead when emergency services arrived at the crime scene after 7pm on Saturday night, having suffered a significant and obvious head injury, apparently caused by a weapon. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “The injury is consistent with what appears to be blunt force trauma,” Miles said. “We will await the outcome of the autopsy before we make an absolute determination of what weapon may have been used.” Police believe the boy’s injuries were inflicted within a period of eight hours prior to their arrival, but are awaiting the results of an autopsy for further details about when and how he was allegedly murdered. Emergency services were called by “another relative” who had spoken to the accused woman. The woman was arrested at the home and was to face Townsville magistrates court on Monday. Her children were “being cared for external to the home of the moment”, the police officer said. There were no other adults present at the time of the alleged murder.

Photograph: Security Services Archive, Czech Republic Carlos the Jackal Secret police tricked Carlos the Jackal into fleeing Prague, archives reveal New book casts doubt on accepted picture of communist bloc support for violent radicals during cold war Shaun Walker Mon 27 Jan 2025 12.05 GMT First published on Mon 27 Jan 2025 11.20 GMT Share In June 1986, a pair of operatives from communist Czechoslovakia’s StB intelligence service made contact with a mysterious couple staying at a Prague hotel. The man’s passport identified him as a Syrian diplomat called Walid Wattar; his pregnant wife also had a Syrian diplomatic passport. In fact, the man was Venezuela-born Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, better known as Carlos the Jackal , perhaps the world’s most wanted terrorist at the time. He was with his wife, Magdalena Kopp, recently released from French prison. Ramírez Sánchez spent a lot of time behind the iron curtain and was known to receive support from the KGB and East Gemany’s Stasi. But a new book based on the archives of the Czechoslovak secret police suggests the picture of communist bloc support for him and other violent radical actors during the late cold war period is not so simple. “There was this dramatic Reagan idea that the Soviets and all the other services were training them, giving them whatever they needed and then directing them to carry out attacks in the west,” said Daniela Richterova, a specialist in intelligence studies at King’s College London and author of the book, Watching the Jackals. “In fact, the reality was more complicated.” In this instance, the Czechoslovak agents told Ramírez Sánchez and his wife that they knew who they really were, and that they had information that French intelligence operatives were in Prague and on a mission to “liquidate” them. The officers advised them to leave the country immediately. Within hours, Ramírez Sánchez was on a flight out. View image in fullscreen Carlos the Jackal’s request for a Czechoslovak diplomatic visa under an assumed South Yemeni identity. Photograph: Security Services Archive, Czech Republic But the supposed French plot was fictitious; the StB simply wanted Ramírez Sánchez, who with his associates had been responsible for a wave of terrorism across Europe over the previous decade, out of the country, fearful of his reputation and his methods. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, communist Prague often acted as a haven for operatives from revolutionary and terrorist movements from across the world, who used Czechoslovakia as a safe place for meetings, planning and sometimes liaisons with the local authorities. Richterova worked in the archive of the former Czechoslovak security service in Prague, which has made all but a handful of its communist-era documents open for viewing, giving an unprecedented insight into the links between Czechoslovakia and various violent non-state actors during the cold war. The archives show there was a close relationship with Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organisation, and the book details the extensive relations between the PLO’s security service, led by Arafat’s No 2, Abu Iyad, and Czechoslovak authorities. A visit by Iyad to Prague in 1981 resulted in agreement on a package that included intelligence exchange, joint operations, arms supplies and security training. Files suggest officials in the city even discussed an operation in which the Palestinians would target Czech dissidents living abroad and either assassinate or kidnap them, though the discussions came to nothing. Though there were times when the Czechoslovaks cosied up to Middle Eastern groups, there were many more occasions when it was clear Prague was confused and alarmed by the presence of Arab operatives on its territory and struggled to keep tabs on them. While there were deep links with the PLO, the StB remained wary of more radical Palestinian groups, as well as of rogue actors such as Ramírez Sánchez. The full story on Moscow and the KGB’s relations with these groups remains locked away in the Russian archives. But the Czechoslovak documents made it clear “there was no coordinated policy and no direction from the Soviet Union”, Richterova said. The book also shows that the communist-era intelligence service, so feared when it came to domestic dissidents, was less than impressive when it came to tracking these foreign groups, whose members often had a whole stash of diplomatic passports under various identities issued by Middle Eastern countries. “The StB operatives didn’t speak Arabic, they didn’t quite understand who is a member of what group, and when they put them on these persona non grata lists it didn’t work at all,” Richterova said.

The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, called the vote a “bitter day for all those who long for freedom and democracy”. The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, expressed mock surprise that “only” 87.6% of the electorate appeared to have backed Lukashenko. “Will the rest fit inside the prisons?” he wrote on X, referring to Lukashenko’s repressive rule under which thousands of Belarusians have been jailed. But the authoritarian leader received praise from his closest ally, Vladimir Putin, who congratulated him on Monday for achieving a “confident victory”. View image in fullscreen Lukashenko casting his ballot in Minsk on Sunday. Photograph: Belarus President Press-Service/EPA The country’s central election commission announced on Sunday evening that preliminary results showed Lukashenko, 70, securing nearly 87% of the presidential vote, granting him a seventh term, while the runner-up received only 3%. Lukashenko’s four challengers, all loyal to him and running merely to lend an air of legitimacy to the vote, praised the incumbent throughout the campaign. Lukashenko, known as “Europe’s last dictator” – a nickname he embraces – has been in power since 1994 and has ruled the country of 9 million people with an iron hand. The exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya denounced the vote as a “farce”. “What in the democratic world you call elections has nothing in common with this event in Belarus,” Tsikhanouskaya said. ‘A ritual for a dictator’: Lukashenko critics decry Belarus election Read more Tsikhanouskaya, whose husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, has been held incommunicado for almost a year, had urged voters to cross off everyone on the ballot. She called on world leaders not to recognise the result from a country “where all independent media and opposition parties have been destroyed and prisons are filled by political prisoners”. The election committee said 3.6% of voters followed Tsikhanouskaya’s advice and voted against all candidates. Lukashenko, who previously maintained a delicate balance between the EU and Moscow, became increasingly reliant on Russia both economically and politically after the contested 2020 presidential election , marred by allegations of fraud and unprecedented protests that brought hundreds of thousands of Belarusians on to the streets. The violent crackdown by Lukashenko’s security forces that followed turned him into a pariah in the west, pushing him closer to Moscow and in effect transforming Minsk into a vassal state of Russia – an alliance that proved crucial for Putin when Belarus became a launch point for his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Human rights groups estimate more than 500,000 Belarusians have left the country since 2020 – mostly to Poland and Lithuania – out of a population of 9 million. Anti-Lukashenko demonstrations took place in cities across Europe amid the election, with people carrying the white-red-white traditional Belarusian flag – abolished by Lukashenko in 1995 – at events in different cities. They were not able to cast ballots, with Belarus having scrapped voting from abroad. View image in fullscreen Protesters hang a banner reading ‘stop Luka’ from a tower in Warsaw on Sunday. Photograph: Marek Antoni Iwanczuk/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock During a rambling four-hour press conference after he cast his ballot on Sunday, Lukashenko threatened to punish relatives in Belarus of those participating in protests abroad. “You’re just putting your people at risk,” Lukashenko said, addressing the opposition in exile. “And as for you, we will deal with you.” At the same conference, Lukashenko said he would not rule out running again for president in 2030. He said he “did not give a damn” about western condemnation though observers believe the Belarusian leader has been making careful overtures towards the west in recent months, widely seen as an effort to get relief from sanctions.

Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on Sunday that the vote was a “bitter day for all those who long for freedom and democracy”. “The people of Belarus had no choice. Instead of free and fair elections and a life without fear and arbitrariness, they experience oppression, repression and human rights violations on a daily basis,” she said. Lukashenko, who faced no serious challenge from the four other candidates on the ballot on Sunday, took 86.8% of the vote, according to initial results published on the Central Election Commission’s official Telegram account. The EU’s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said Sunday’s “sham election” had been “neither free, nor fair” and that the EU would maintain sanctions against the regime. Lukashenko, a 70-year-old former collective farm boss, has been in power since 1994. After the last elections in August 2020, he launched a brutal crackdown in response to the largest ever anti-government protests in Belarusian history. His international isolation deepened in 2022 when he made his country a launchpad for Russian president Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on Sunday, Lukashenko said he had “no regrets” about allowing his “older brother” Putin to use Belarus to invade Ukraine. “I do not regret anything,” he said in response to a question from AFP, during an often rambling press conference with international media that ran over four hours. He also declined to say if this would be his last election, adding that he was “not about to die”, and had no specific successor in mind. Amid rumours of a family succession, Lukashenko denied that any of his three sons would want to take over from him. The autocrat said there could be “future presidents” among current regional governors, or members of government or parliament but not a woman, making the point in characteristically misogynistic fashion. “I’m totally against a woman doing this job. A woman can’t be a dictator but we have quite a few men who could be leaders,” he said. He also denied that the recent release of political prisoners was motivated by an attempt to build bridges with the west. More than 250 political prisoners have been freed since last July, although 1,250 remain in jail. Some analysts see this as an attempted rapprochement with the west, as Lukashenko vies not to be left out of any detente that could result from a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. But Lukashenko rejected this interpretation, saying: “I don’t give a damn about the west”. Some of his political opponents, he said, had “chosen” prison or exile. Asked about one of Belarus’s most prominent jailed opposition figures, Maria Kolesnikova , Lukashenko said she was “fine” and that he had intervened personally to bring about a visit from her father last year. Kolesnikova, one of the leaders of the 2020 campaign to unseat Lukashenko, has been in jail since September 2020. Held in strict isolation, she was long denied visits from family or lawyers, until her father was allowed to visit her in prison last November. Up to half a million Belarusians are thought to have fled their homeland after the brutal repression of 2020, with the largest communities of exiles in Lithuania and Poland. Criticism of the regime is banned in Belarus. People interviewed by AFP in Minsk and other towns who voiced support for Lukashenko were afraid of giving their surnames. “I will vote for Lukashenko because things have improved since he became president,” said 42-year-old farmer Alexei in the tiny village of Gubichi in south-eastern Belarus. But, like many in Belarus, he said he wished “for there not to be a war” in neighbouring Ukraine. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya , the Belarusian opposition leader in exile, said the so-called election was “a sham designed to tighten oppression” and “a farce built on fear, repression and lies”. She entered the 2020 contest after her husband, the opposition candidate, Syarhei Tsikhanouski, was arrested on the campaign trail. This weekend s...",

A French air force helicopter was dispatched to find the man after he set off his distress beacon at 3pm on Saturday, approximately 50 miles (80km) west of Lacanau in south-west France . The helicopter arrived to find his 12-metre yacht, the Tiger PA, “eviscerated” in the Atlantic, according to Atlantic Maritime Prefecture, a French government organisation. Two divers were then winched down to the wreckage, where they discovered an empty raft. A Portuguese cargo ship and a Spanish hospital ship were diverted to the area and mobilised to begin a search to find the sailor, whose identity is not yet known, alongside the French navy. After several hours, the search was called off at 1.30am on Sunday “due to a lack of new information”, the prefecture said. French authorities first received an alert from their British counterparts about the yacht on Friday evening, which was flying under an American flag, because it had stopped responding to radio messages. A nearby Portuguese ship then managed to establish radio contact after several attempts, according to the prefecture. A 73-year-old man of British nationality reportedly indicated that he was alone on board, safe and continuing on his way.

Sweden’s security service has seized control of a vessel as part of the inquiry, the country’s prosecution authority said. “We are now carrying out a number of concrete investigative measures, but I cannot go into what they consist of due to the ongoing preliminary investigation,” senior prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said. View image in fullscreen Latvia was coordinating with Nato and Baltic Sea nations to clarify what had happened, the prime minister, Evika Siliņa, told reporters. Photograph: Simon Wohlfahrt/AFP/Getty Images “We have determined that there is most likely external damage and that it is significant,” the Latvian prime minister, Evika Siliņa, told reporters after an extraordinary government meeting. Latvia was coordinating with Nato and the countries of the Baltic Sea region to clarify the circumstances, she said separately in a post on X. Latvia’s navy said earlier on Sunday it had dispatched a patrol boat to inspect a ship and that two other vessels were also subject to investigation. Nato said last week it would deploy frigates, patrol aircraft and naval drones in the Baltic Sea to help protect critical infrastructure and reserved the right to take action against ships suspected of posing a security threat. “Nato ships and aircrafts are working together with national resources from the Baltic Sea countries to investigate and, if necessary, take action,” the alliance said on Sunday. Swedish navy spokesperson Jimmie Adamsson earlier told Reuters it was too soon to say what caused the damage to the cable or whether it was intentional or a technical fault. The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said his country was cooperating closely with Latvia and Nato over the latest incident. “Sweden will contribute important capabilities to the ongoing effort to investigate the suspected incident,” Kristersson said on X. Finnish police last month seized a tanker carrying Russian oil and said they suspected the vessel had damaged the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and four telecoms cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed. The cable that broke early on Sunday linked the Latvian city of Ventspils with Sweden’s Gotland island, and was damaged in Sweden’s exclusive economic zone, the Latvian navy said. Unlike seabed gas pipelines and power cables, which can take many months to repair after damage, fibre optic cables that have suffered damage in the Baltic Sea have generally been restored within weeks. A Swedish Post and Telecom Authority spokesperson said it was aware of the situation but had no further comment. Explore more on these topics Latvia Sweden Europe news Share Reuse this content",

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed earlier that the hostage release - which will include female soldier Agam Berger - will take place on Thursday. Another three hostages are expected to be released on Saturday as previously planned. It means tens of thousands of Palestinian people are now heading home to the devastated northern areas of the strip – such as Jabalia and Beit Hanoun - after forced displacement by the Israeli military during the war. Some of these people have spoken to the Associated Press. Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, said she walked 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to reach her home in Gaza City, where she found it damaged but still habitable. She also saw her younger sister for the first time in over a year. “It was a long trip, but a happy one,” she said. “The most important thing is that we returned.” Palestinian people leave southern Gaza to return to the north.

In the dawn light, large crowds of people began the long walk back to their homes – or what remained of them – in columns heavy with emotion and trepidation. More than 200,000 people crossed to the north in the morning, a security official told the AFP news agency. Many knew they would be returning to nothing more than ruins , but wanted to pitch tents on their own land after long months shifting between crowded camps for displaced people in the south of the strip. “My heart is beating. I thought I would never come back,” said Osama, a 50-year-old public servant and father of five, as he arrived in Gaza City. “Whether the ceasefire succeeds or not, we will never leave Gaza City and the north again, even if Israel would sent a tank for each one of us. No more displacement,” he told the Associated Press. View image in fullscreen Displaced Palestinians make their way back to their homes in northern Gaza. Photograph: Ramadan Abed/Reuters Some were looking for loved ones who had been unable or unwilling to leave; others hoped only to find bodies they knew were buried under rubble , to give them a dignified burial. The return had been scheduled to start on Sunday, but was delayed for 24 hours by the first major crisis in a fragile ceasefire deal. When the Israeli hostage Arbel Yehoud was not released on Saturday as expected, Israel accused Hamas of violating an agreement to release the remaining female civilians first, and said the checkpoints to the north would remain closed. As the two sides traded accusations, the US president, Donald Trump, speculated about “clearing out” Gaza by moving up to 1.5 million Palestinians to neighbouring Arab countries. His comments added to fears among some in Gaza that they would never be allowed back to the north. View image in fullscreen Palestinians return to northern Gaza on Monday. Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP ‘He left for paradise’: hastily dug graves are visited as Gaza ceasefire takes effect Read more Far-right politicians in Israel who opposed the ceasefire deal and want to restart the war, including the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, have also been vocal advocates of Jewish settlements in Gaza and long-term Israeli rule. Last-minute talks late into Sunday evening shored up the ceasefire deal, securing an agreement to release three hostages on Thursday – ahead of the original schedule – and open the routes north on Monday morning. Israel said Hamas had also provided details on the status of all 26 hostages scheduled for release during this stage of the agreement. Some of them are believed to be dead. Many Palestinians waited through the night at checkpoints to start their difficult journey as soon as possible on Monday morning. An Israeli military spokesperson announced overnight that the first checkpoint would open to people on foot at 5am, and vehicles would be allowed across after inspection from 9am. “No sleep. I have everything packed and ready to go with the first light of day,” Ghada, a mother of five, told Reuters on Sunday evening. “At least we are going back home. Now I can say war is over and I hope it will stay calm.” Families trudged along roads destroyed by fighting, past wastelands of concrete that had once been familiar shops, offices, restaurants and apartment buildings, carrying the few possessions that had survived the war in plastic bags or on makeshift carts. The crowd included children singing and playing tambourines, an amputee heading slowly north on crutches, and elderly Palestinians in wheelchairs or inching forward supported by younger relatives. Inside Gaza City, cheering crowds waited to greet them. 1:04 Drone footage shows thousands of Palestinians waiting to return to northern Gaza Strip – video The first reunions happened within hours, with one tearful embrace between a mother and son captured on video.

Hundreds of thousands of people fled the area after blanket evacuation orders, and whole swathes of buildings were bombed intensively or destroyed by Israeli military demolitions.

Israel has ordered the UN agency to vacate its headquarters in East Jerusalem by Thursday, after the Israeli Knesset passed a law on 28 October banning its operations in Israel and the Palestinian territories. It has not yet said how it will implement a related law ending all Israeli government cooperation with Unwra, which could come into force on the same day and strangle its operations in the West Bank and Gaza. The move comes as Unrwa and other aid groups have been able, as part of the ceasefire agreement, to pour aid into the Gaza Strip after months of Israeli obstruction , amid warnings of imminent famine in some areas. Unrwa has 7,000 trucks of supplies outside Gaza and 1,500 under procurement, according to Sam Rose, its acting director of emergency operations. He told the Guardian he expected it to have provided food parcels to 1 million people in the 10 days since the ceasefire, and was also primed to send stocks including tarpaulins and mattresses for 1.6 million people. The Israeli government is adamant that Unrwa staff took part in the 7 October massacre, and that Hamas has infiltrated the organisation, compromising its neutrality. The UN commissioned two independent reports on aspects of the allegations, and says it acted to protect its neutrality where clear evidence was produced. If the non-cooperation measures are implemented in full, Israel’s action would amount to the first forced eviction of a UN agency from a member state, an issue that led the UN’s general assembly in December to vote to ask the international court of justice to give an urgent advisory opinion. In addition, two Palestinian human rights groups are seeking an Israeli supreme court injunction delaying the law on grounds that fundamental human rights of Palestinians would be violated. Despite this, Danny Danon, the Israeli UN ambassador, wrote to UN officials last Friday to say the headquarters must be vacated by Thursday. Unrwa may be forced to stop saving lives in Gaza. Will the world let that happen? | Philippe Lazzarini Read more Israel has declined to spell out further how it will implement the Knesset votes. But Unrwa staff believe it will mean international employees will not be given visas, any aid with an Unrwa label will be blocked from crossing the borders into Gaza and liaison between it and Israel Defense Forces about security will end. Unrwa bank accounts are also likely to be frozen. “We are going to be left with a gaping hole,” Rose said. Almost half of the food being sent into Gaza is organised through the Unwra distribution network, even if not all of that food has an Unwra label. Rose added: “In the first three says since the ceasefire started, we distributed food parcels to just under 300,000 people south of the Wadi Gaza, roughly 15% of the people in this part of Gaza. At this rate Unrwa will have reached 1 million people in the next 10 days. It is a dramatic increase, and there is no other organisation with the breadth and size to undertake our work.” Rose has always been sceptical about using the number of trucks entering Gaza as a reliable measure of the amount of aid entering the territory, since some trucks may enter half empty. But more than 2,400 trucks entered Gaza in the four days after the ceasefire, more than the number allowed into Gaza in the whole of October. “The nature of Unrwa’s services – primary health care and education – is such that women and children will bear the brunt of any disruption and the overall humanitarian effort will be massively undermined,” he said. Arguably, the effects of the ban amount to a breach of the ceasefire. With Donald Trump now ventilating plans for the deportation of millions from Gaza , some UN staff fear Israel and the US regard the closure of Unwra as a precondition for persuading Palestinians to travel to Jordan and Egypt. In a standoff about the legitimacy of Israel’s effort to close Unrwa, the UN declined to make contingency plans for other agencies to take over. 2:17 Israel's Unrwa ban prompts condemnation and concern for Gaza – video report A report last wee...",

The authorities, installed by the rebel forces that toppled longtime president Bashar al-Assad last month, said they had carried out multiple arrests in the western Homs area over unspecified “violations”. Official news agency Sana said the authorities on Friday accused members of a “criminal group” of using a security sweep to commit abuses against residents while “posing as members of the security services”. US-based Syrian Christians eye new regime with mixture of hope and fear Read more The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said on Sunday that “these arrests follow grave violations and summary executions that had cost the lives of 35 people over the past 72 hours.” It also said that “members of religious minorities” had suffered “humiliations”. Most of those executed are former officers in the toppled Assad government who had presented themselves in centres set up by the new authorities, according to the Britain-based monitor, which has a network of sources inside Syria. “Dozens of members of local armed groups under the control of the new Sunni Islamist coalition in power who participated in the security operations” in the Homs area “have been arrested”, the observatory said. It added that these groups “carried out reprisals and settled old scores with members of the Alawite minority to which Bashar al-Assad belongs, taking advantage of the state of chaos, the proliferations of arms and their ties to the new authorities”. The observatory listed “mass arbitrary arrests, atrocious abuse, attacks against religious symbols, mutilations of corpses, summary and brutal executions targeting civilians”, which it said showed “an unprecedented level of cruelty and violence”. Civil Peace Group said there had been civilian victims in multiple villages in the Homs area during the security sweep. The group “condemned the unjustified violations” including the killing of unarmed men. Since seizing power, the new authorities have sought to reassure religious and ethnic minorities in Syria that their rights would be upheld. Members of Assad’s Alawite minority have expressed fear of retaliation over abuses during his clan’s decades in power.

        "full_content": "10.42 GMT Hamas says Israel is violating ceasefire by blocking Palestinians' return to northern Gaza Hamas has accused Israel of violating the fragile Gaza ceasefire agreement by preventing tens of thousands of Palestinian people from returning to their homes in the northern part of the strip. “The occupation is stalling under the pretext of prisoner Arbel Yehoud, despite the movement informing mediators that she is alive and providing all the necessary guarantees for her release,” the Palestinian militant group said in a statement. “Hamas holds Israel responsible for the delay in implementing the agreement,” it added. Hamas freed four female Israeli soldiers on Saturday, and Israel released about 200 Palestinian prisoners. But Israel said another hostage, the female civilian Arbel Yehoud, was supposed to have been released ahead of the soldiers, and that it would not open the Netzarim corridor – that bisects the northern and southern halves of the strip - until she was freed. It also accused Hamas of failing to provide details on the conditions of hostages set to be freed in the coming weeks. Many Palestinians are waiting for instruction from the Israeli military on Salah al-Din street, south of the Netzarim Corridor, and on the al-Rashid road, west of the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza . “Tens of thousands of displaced people are waiting near the Netzarim Corridor to return to the northern Gaza Strip,” Gaza’s civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency.

Pompeo and his top aide, Brian Hook, who have faced threats from Iran since they took hard-line stances on the Islamic Republic during Trump’s first administration, were told of the loss of protection on Wednesday evening. Just a day earlier Trump similarly ended protection for his former national security adviser John Bolton, who was fired as national security adviser during Trump’s first term, and became a vocal Trump critic. Trump ends security detail for three of his former officials despite threats from Iran Read more Bolton later wrote a book whose publication the White House unsuccessfully sought to block on grounds that it disclosed national security information. Bolton, who has been targeted for assassination by Iran, said in a statement that he was disappointed but not surprised by the decision. Two senior Republican senators on Sunday urged Trump to rethink his decision to strip personal security to Bolton and Pompeo. “I would encourage the president to revisit the decision for those people who are being targeted by Iran,” Tom Cotton, chair of the US Senate intelligence committee, told Fox News Sunday. The United States charged a member of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in 2022 with plotting to murder Bolton, who served as Trump’s third national security adviser until he was dismissed in 2019. Iran promised revenge after Trump ordered a drone strike in 2020 that killed General Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, the overseas arm of the elite Revolutionary Guards. “I’ve reviewed the intelligence in the last few days. The threat to anyone involved in President Donald Trump’s strike (on) Suleimani is persistent. It’s real. Iran is committed to vengeance against all of these people,” Cotton said. Trump told reporters that the government could not protect people forever and said former officials could pay for security out of their own pockets. Lindsey Graham, a strong Trump backer, told CNN Trump’s move could make it harder to recruit the right people in the future. “Whether you like John Bolton or not, that’s not the question for me … We need to make sure that if you serve in our government and you take on a foreign power at the request of the administration that we do not leave you hanging,” he said. Trump also revoked security clearances for dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter saying the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a “Russian information operation.” Trump had soured on Pompeo some months ago, saying publicly that he would play no role in his new administration. In a social media post this week, he fired Hook from his presidentially appointed position on the board of the Wilson Center, a think tank. A representative for Pompeo did not immediately reply to a request for comment, and Hook has not responded to multiple voice and text messages from the AP since Bolton was stripped of his protection on Tuesday. Asked about the decision to end Pompeo and Hook’s security, Trump replied to reporters: “Do you want to have a large detail of people guarding people for the rest of their lives? I mean, there’s risks to everything.” According to a March 2022 report to Congress, the State Department said it was paying more than $2m per month to provide 24-hour security to Pompeo and Hook. But later determinations did not give a dollar amount. The state department told lawmakers that threats against Pompeo and Hook remain “serious and credible” and continue to warrant government-provided security details. A former senior Biden administration official who was briefed on the matter said Trump administration officials are “well aware” of the “active threats” against the former government officials and called the move “highly irresponsible”.

After asking the mother of a sick boy routine questions about his family history, the woman looked outraged. Marching Askari outside, she took off her colourful shawl and laid it on her lap. “Most of the answers to your pointless questions are here,” she said, pointing to intricate embroidery that symbolised everything, from the woman’s community, to her marriage status and her number of children. “I know my son is very ill and he will die,” the woman told Askari. “When he is gone, I will go home and unravel one of these black flowers here on my shawl.” View image in fullscreen A coverlet from Sindh. This was Askari’s first brush with the ornate fabrics of Pakistan’s south-east province of Sindh and the stories, biographies and histories woven within them. It awoke her curiosity, which grew into a lifelong passion for collecting unique textiles crafted by the diverse communities of Sindh and her attempt to understand the narratives documented in the cloth. Fifty years later, Askari’s almost 1,000-piece collection – the largest of its kind – has formed the basis of Pakistan’s first dedicated textile museum , which she and her husband, Hasan, a former British Museum trustee, opened in Karachi in December. “The hope is that people will come here to engage, and possibly even marvel, at the possibilities our artistic traditions can offer,” said Askari. She said the textile traditions of Sindh were among the oldest in the world, dating back centuries to the ancient Indus valley civilisation of south Asia, which was centred in the province. In a reflection of the geography of the region, which has a long history of being an east-west trade crossroads, she said the Sindhi fabrics she had collected represented a unique synthesis of traditions spanning not only Pakistan but China, India, Iran and central Asia. Most of the fabrics in her collection have been woven on a handloom and are made using natural dyes from roots, leaves and flowers, traditions that continue in the smaller rural and nomadic communities of Sindh, even if diminished in the face of modernity. Askari, who lives between the UK and Pakistan, established herself as a pioneering ambassador for Pakistan’s rich, but often neglected textile traditions in 1997, when she was invited to curate one of the first international exhibits of Pakistani fabrics at the V&A. The exhibit, Colours of the Indus, drawn from a collection endowed to the museum by a Pakistani benefactor that had lain forgotten until Askari dug it out from the archive, was a huge success. She has since published several books examining the region’s diverse textile history. Askari had considered donating her own collection, which for years had accumulated in boxes at her home, to the V&A but had a change of heart. “We knew if we gave to a museum like the V&A it would likely sit in the vaults for years, and be brought out into daylight maybe once in a decade,” she said. “So we thought, why not just open our own museum in Sindh, which can enrich people’s understanding of their own heritage. It’s our way of repaying a debt to all those who have played a part in contributing to this collection.” View image in fullscreen A woman’s skirt from Sindh. The museum, named the Haveli, features five galleries showcasing different kinds of embroidery Askari has collected from some of the remotest corners of Pakistan, ranging from ceremonial cloths traditionally sent from a groom to a bride before a wedding, to dowry purses and vibrant animal adornments worn by camels. The couple hope to send a powerful message with the opening exhibit of the museum, titled “A coat of many colours”, which pointedly celebrates the contributions of minority Hindu communities to Sindh’s fabric traditions. Before partition and the creation of a separate India and Pakistan in 1947, Sindh, which now borders the Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan, had been 30% Hindu. However, in the decades since, the number of Hindus living in Pakistan, an Islamic republic, have dwindled in the face of sustained intolerance and persecution. Hasan said: “At a time when so much of south Asia is dominated by sectarian strife, and religion has become so weaponised for division, we wanted to make a statement of unity. We desperately believe in recognising contributions that minority groups have made to textile traditions in Sindh to show they have not been forgotten.” The museum was, he emphasised, “not just about showcasing crafts, but also to ma...",

It marks the first time the prosecutor has built a case around systemic crimes against women and girls, legal experts say. It is also a rare moment of vindication for Afghan activists, who over the last three years have often felt abandoned by the international community even as Taliban oppression deepened. Shukria Barakzai, activist and former member of the Afghan parliament, said in a statement: “This historic announcement is a powerful message that impunity for flagrant violations of women’s rights is not to be tolerated in Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world. We are deeply grateful to all our Afghan sisters who have worked relentlessly toward this moment.” Karim Khan, the ICC chief prosecutor, said in a statement that the Taliban’s supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, are “criminally responsible” for ongoing persecution of girls, women, the LGBTQ+ community and their allies. “Our commitment to pursue accountability for gender-based crimes , including gender persecution , remains an absolute priority,” he said. The team will file warrants for other senior Taliban officials soon, he added. Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban’s supreme leader. Photograph: Reuters Since sweeping back to power in 2021 , the Taliban have issued more than 80 decrees that violate women’s basic rights. Women are barred from most work , secondary education and public spaces, and their daily life is restricted in various ways. Recently the group banned windows in rooms frequently used by women, to ensure they could not be seen by men not related to them. New buildings should be constructed without windows in these rooms and existing windows should be covered up, the order stipulated. Activists are campaigning for the crime of gender apartheid to be recognised under international law, to reflect the scale of Taliban restrictions. Akila Radhakrishnan, strategic legal adviser on gender justice for the Atlantic Council, said that although the ICC had sought to prosecute gender crimes before, this is the first time they had been the main focus in a case. She said: “It is a landmark, because this is the first time a case has been built around crimes of gender persecution. Usually, gender crimes are ancillary, an add-on to a case driven by other [crimes]. “The request for an arrest warrant … demonstrates the systematic way in which these violations have been working in tandem to oppress girls and women under the Taliban’s gender apartheid.” There may not be any immediate consequences. Neither man is likely to travel anywhere they could face arrest – Akhundzada rarely even leaves his base in Kandahar – and the group has only responded with defiance to other international pressure over their treatment of women. Nevertheless, Radhakrishnan said, even without any expectation of a day in court, the warrant sent an important message. She said: “It helps to stigmatise what is happening in Afghanistan. We can now say that people engaging with the Taliban are on notice that what their officials are doing is criminal. There are warrant requests out for the most serious crimes that exist.” Afghan women who have endured violence and exile for demanding basic rights said the case marked a critical vindication of their struggle. Zahra Haqparast was jailed by the Taliban in 2022 for protesting against restrictions on women’s lives, and now lives in exile. She said: “This is the best news I’ve heard since the Taliban came to power. “I was cooking lunch when I heard the news, and I was so happy that I ran to check immediately if it was true. By the time I got back, an hour had passed and my food was burnt.” Despite initial outrage at Taliban restrictions when the group seized power in 2021, Afghan women say an international community that once claimed to be fighting in their name has not done enough to fight back. Heather Barr, deputy women’s rights director at Human Rights Watch, said: “They have felt ignored by the world while the Taliban has systematically stripped their rights away day after day. This step by the ICC is a good start. Afghan women and girls are owed full justice for the Taliban’s crimes and an end, now, to Taliban abuses.” Afghan activists also called on the court ...",

Income from permit fees and other spending by foreign climbers is a key source of revenue and employment for the poor country, which is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains. A permit to climb 8,849-metre (29,032ft) Everest would cost $15,000 (£12,000), said Narayan Prasad Regmi, the director general of the Department of Tourism, announcing the rise in the $11,000 fee that has been in place for nearly a decade. “The royalty [permit fees] had not been reviewed for a long time. We have updated them now,” Regmi said. The new rate will come into effect from September and apply for the popular April-May climbing season along the standard South East Ridge, or South Col route, pioneered by the New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Fees for the less popular September-November season and the rarely climbed December-February season will also increase by 36%, to $7,500 and $3,750 respectively. Some expedition organisers said the increase, under discussion since last year, was unlikely to discourage climbers. About 300 permits are issued each year for Everest. “We expected this hike in permit fees,” said Lukas Furtenbach of the Austria-based expedition organiser Furtenbach Adventures. He said it was an “understandable step” from the government of Nepal . “I am sure the additional funds will be somehow used to protect the environment and improve safety on Everest,” Furtenbach said. Regmi did not say what the extra revenue would be used for. Hundreds of climbers try to scale Everest and several other Himalayan peaks every year. Nepal is often criticised by mountaineering experts for allowing too many climbers on Everest and doing little to keep it clean or to ensure climbers’ safety. Regmi said campaigns to collect waste and rope fixing as well as other safety measures were undertaken regularly. Climbers returning from the Everest say the mountain is becoming increasingly dry and rocky with less snow or other precipitation, which experts say could be the result of global warming or other environmental changes.

The Taliban praised the swap as a step toward the “normalization” of ties between the US and Afghanistan , but that probably remains a tall order as most countries in the world still do not recognize their rule and another two Americans are believed held. The Taliban’s foreign ministry in Kabul confirmed the swap, saying two US citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment in 2008. The family of Ryan Corbett, one American held by the Taliban, confirmed he had been released in a statement. Corbett, who had lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the US-backed government , was detained by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip. “Our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan’s life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,” the family’s statement said. They thanked both Donald Trump and Joe Biden , as well as many government officials, for their efforts in freeing him. Corbett’s family also praised the Middle Eastern country of Qatar “for their vital role in facilitating Ryan’s release”. Both CNN and the New York Times identified the second American released as William McKenty, though no other details have emerged about his identity or what he was doing in Afghanistan. Mohammed, 55, was a prisoner in California after his 2008 conviction. The Bureau of Prisons early on Tuesday listed Mohammed as not being in their custody. Hafiz Zia Ahmad Takal, a Taliban foreign ministry deputy spokesperson, said Mohammed had arrived in Afghanistan and was with his family. Photos released by the Taliban showed him being welcomed back in his home province of Nangarhar, in the country’s east, with multicolored garlands. Mohammed said he had spent time behind bars in Bagram and also Washington DC. “It’s a joy seeing your family and coming to your homeland. The greatest joy is to come and join your Muslim brothers,” he said. He was detained on the battlefield in Nangarhar and later taken to the US. A federal jury convicted him on charges of securing heroin and opium that he knew were bound for the United States and, in doing so, assisting terrorism activity. The justice department at the time referred to Mohammed as “a violent jihadist and narcotics trafficker” who “sought to kill US soldiers in Afghanistan using rockets”. He was the first person to be convicted under US narco-terrorism laws. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before Biden left office, his administration had been trying to work out a deal to free Corbett, as well as George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi, in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantánamo Bay. Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban’s intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country. Habibi, an Afghan American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company, also went missing in 2022. The Taliban have denied they have Habibi. For their part, the Taliban called the exchange the result of “long and fruitful negotiations” with the US and said it was a good example of solving problems through dialogue. “The Islamic Emirate looks positively at the actions of the United States of America that help the normalization and development of relations between the two countries,” it said.

The woman’s body was found in a classroom at the state-run RG Kar medical college and hospital on 9 August. Other doctors stayed off work for weeks to demand justice for her and better security at public hospitals. Sanjay Roy, the police volunteer, was convicted by judge Anirban Das on Saturday , who said circumstantial evidence had proved the charges against him. Roy had claimed he was innocent and that he had been framed, and sought clemency. The federal police, who investigated the case, said the crime belonged to the “rarest-of-rare” category and Roy, therefore, deserved the death penalty. “I do not consider it as a rarest-of-rare crime,” Das said as he sentenced Roy to life in jail on both the counts of rape and murder on Monday. “Life imprisonment, meaning imprisonment until death.” Murdered Indian doctor’s father speaks out: ‘All I can do now is get her justice’ Read more The judge said he had come to the conclusion it was not a rarest-of-rare crime after considering all the evidence and the circumstances linked to it. He said Roy could appeal to a higher court. The sentence was announced in a packed courtroom on Monday as the judge allowed the public to witness proceedings. The fast-tracked trial had not been open to the public. The parents of the junior doctor were among those in court on Monday. Security was stepped up with dozens of police personnel deployed at the court complex.

Photograph: Rajat Gupta/EPA The parents had said earlier they were not satisfied with the investigation and suspected more people were involved in the crime. Their lawyer, Amartya Dey, told Reuters on Monday that they had sought the death penalty for Roy and also demanded that those involved in what they called the “larger conspiracy” be brought to justice. Protesting doctors had said that demonstrations would continue until justice was done. India’s federal police cited 128 witnesses in its investigation, of whom 51 were examined during the fast-tracked trial that began in November. Police have also charged the officer heading the local police station and the head of the college at the time of the crime with destruction of the crime scene and tampering with evidence.

The Arakan Army (AA) is engaged in a fierce fight with the military for control of Rakhine, where it has seized swaths of territory in the past year, all but cutting off the state capital Sittwe. The Rakhine conflict is one element of the bloody chaos that has engulfed Myanmar since the military ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s civilian government in a 2021 coup, sparking a widespread armed uprising. Myanmar military kills dozens in heaviest airstrikes since 2021 coup Read more The AA posted on its Telegram channel that a military jet had bombed a detention area in Mrauk-U Township at about 4.45 pm (10:15 GMT) on Saturday, where family members of junta soldiers were being held by the AA. “Those who were killed and wounded were family members of soldiers in Myanmar’s Army. We arrested them during fighting,” the AA said in the post. “As we were preparing a plan to release them, they were bombed,” the AA said. Nine children were among those dead, including a two-year-old boy, it said. The others killed were women, according to a list of the dead posted by the AA. Photos of the aftermath posted on the Telegram channel showed a long row of bodies laid on the floor in a grassy area, covered in white sheets. A number of people could be seen grieving close by. AFP has attempted to contact the junta for comment about the incident but calls have not been answered. The military is struggling to fight opposition to its rule on multiple fronts around Myanmar and it has been regularly accused of using air and artillery strikes to hit civilian communities. It is unclear whether the strike in Mrauk-U Township was mistargeted or if the junta was unaware the area was being used as a detention site for soldiers’ families. As well as youth-led “People’s Defence Forces” that emerged to oppose the coup, the military is also battling numerous long-established and well-armed ethnic minority armed groups. These groups, which include the AA, control large areas of territory along Myanmar’s borders. The UN Development Programme warned in November that Rakhine was heading towards famine as fighting squeezed commerce and agricultural production. The United Nations said this month more than 3.5 million people have been displaced by the conflict in Myanmar, an increase of 1.5 million from last year.

The call lasted 45 minutes. But Trump is famous for rambling, and getting easily distract, in talks with other leaders, and so it is hard to know whether some topics were left out of the discussion by accident or design. Commenting on the call at the Downing Street lobby briefing, the PM’s spokesperson said it was “very warm”. He told reporters: It was a very warm call, and it was very constructive. The spokesperson was unable to say when Starmer might visit Washingon, or when Trump might visit the UK. But he said UK engagement with the new administration had been very good. There’s a wide range of areas that we look forward to working with President Trump and his an entire team to build on our already very strong and deep relationship.

Photograph: Police handout UK news Father of girl, 14, killed in family’s kitchen in Darlington guilty of murder Simon Vickers, 50, had claimed his daughter, Scarlett, died in a freak accident, but prosecutors said he stabbed her Mark Brown North of England correspondent Mon 27 Jan 2025 12.42 GMT Last modified on Mon 27 Jan 2025 12.44 GMT Share A man who claimed his 14-year-old daughter died in a freak accident after innocent horseplay has been found guilty of her murder. Simon Vickers, 50, claimed he did not know precisely how his daughter, Scarlett Vickers, came to be killed in the family kitchen on a Friday night in July last year. But prosecutors said Vickers was lying and that, “irritated”, he picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed it into Scarlett’s chest. After a trial of more than a week, a jury at Teesside crown court in Middlesbrough found Vickers guilty of murder. They rejected his emotional testimony that he would never knowingly harm his only child. The court heard Vickers had smoked a cannabis joint and drunk four glasses of wine at the family home in Darlington on 5 July. He was in the kitchen with Scarlett and her mother, his partner of 27 years, Sarah Hall, when they all started “mucking about”. It began with throwing grapes, became tickling and then nipping with kitchen tongs. In the course of this Scarlett was stabbed, suffering an 11cm wound to her chest. She bled to death at the scene. A forensic pathologist said the nature of the wound meant the knife must have been held. Vickers initially told police that he must have accidentally thrown the knife at her, thinking he had something else in his hand. Giving evidence, he said that was not what had happened and that he may have accidentally swiped the knife along a work surface and it somehow went into her chest. The prosecutor Mark McKone KC said Vickers was lying. “The prosecution submit that Mr Vickers did not and could not have stabbed his daughter through the heart accidentally,” he said. Alcohol, coupled with the throwing of grapes, with some ending on the floor where their dog could eat them, could have led him to become irritated, McKone said. Vickers had pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and manslaughter. Explore more on these topics UK news England news Share Reuse this content",

On Monday morning, there were 48 flood warnings and 172 alerts in place for England and three Met Office yellow warnings in England and Wales for heavy rain and strong winds. While not as powerful as Éowyn, a low-pressure system was named Storm Herminia by meteorologists in Spain, which was expected to feel the strongest winds. The Met Office warned that heavy, blustery showers and possible thunderstorms would lead to some flooding in London, south-east England and south-west England. It said there could be interruption to power supplies and other services. Strong winds were driving in a succession of showers, some heavy, through Monday and Monday night, before easing during Tuesday morning. There was also a chance of lightning strikes and hail showers. In Wales and parts of the West Midlands in England, the Met Office said heavy rain could lead to some flooding of roads and properties. There was a small chance some rural communities could be cut off by flooded roads. Up to 70mm of rain was expected over some high ground. There was also a warning in place for strong winds on Monday in Wales and across much of southern England that could cause delays to road, rail, air and ferry travel until 6am on Tuesday. The warnings come as scientists have said that the climate emergency is making extreme weather events more common . The flood and wind warnings follow some challenging conditions on Sunday. Okehampton in Devon had 35.8mm of rain, while an 83mph gust was recorded in Berry Head, south Devon, and 81mph in Capel Curig, north Wales. Flooding led to stretches of roads in Devon and Wiltshire being closed overnight on Sunday. Scotland is recovering from the effects of Storm Éowyn. ScotRail said its engineers had made “great progress” in removing debris and repairing damage , but several lines were still affected on Monday. The Largs to Ardrossan line will not reopen on Monday after an overhead gantry was brought down by a falling tree. Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, echoed the warnings about the climate affecting the strength of storms. He told an event in Edinburgh on Monday: “It’s a warning to us that climate change is with us and the ferocity [of it].” Avanti West Coast said services to and from Glasgow and Edinburgh had resumed, but warned of late starts and possible delays on Scottish routes. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks said about 74,000 customers remained without power at the end of Sunday as a result of Éowyn. The Met Office meteorologist Marco Petagna said: “Things are going to stay unsettled in the next few days. We’re getting successive spells of wet and windy weather, which is obviously adding to impacts.” Explore more on these topics UK weather Flooding Scotland England Wales news Share Reuse this content",

The Green-led council says that switching from a two- to four-weekly collection would save it more than £2m a year and help reverse a dip in recycling rates. The council believes it would be the first in England to move to collections every four weeks. Some residents and political opponents have expressed concern that it could lead to more non-recyclable rubbish being fly-tipped and almost 2,000 people have so far signed a Labour petition against the idea. The council argues that it has not seen evidence of fly-tipping increasing in areas that have moved to three-weekly collections and says it has powers to clamp down on offenders. The authority launched a six-week consultation on Monday and hopes to make a decision by the spring. Residents are being asked if collections should stay the same or move to a three-week or four-week pattern. ‘We’ll push the government to be bolder’: Carla Denyer on election success for the Greens Read more Bristol is home to about 483,000 people living in more than 191,000 households, and growing. The council says that on average, each person creates up to 400kg of household waste a year. For the past two years, Bristol has recycled about 45% of its household waste – among the best records in the UK – but the council says the recycling rate is dropping, making change vital. Councillor Martin Fodor, the chair of the environment and sustainability committee, said: “Anything that ends up in the black bin waste is taken away for incineration or sent to landfill – both of which come with serious environmental and cost issues. “Burning or leaving waste to decompose in landfill releases carbon and other harmful substances into the atmosphere. This pollutes the air around us and also contributes to fuelling climate change. “Changing government regulation and the increasing costs of dealing with black bin waste means that to keep managing our city’s waste as we currently do is set to become much more expensive.” The council estimates that the introduction of new charges on disposing black bin waste by incinerating it or sending it to landfill will add over £8m a year on top of existing charges to the cost of managing the city’s waste system, if changes are not made. It says a quarter of black bin waste in Bristol is food waste that could be recycled in the food waste bin and a quarter is paper and card, glass, plastic and cans, textiles and small electrical items that also could all be recycled. Fodor said: “We firmly believe that by collecting black bin waste once every three or four weeks instead of two will increase the amount of waste our city recycles, reduce costs and significantly lower carbon emissions.” The council acknowledges that if it does move to monthly collections, it will have to make changes to how people can recycle, possibly increasing the use of recycling sacks or introducing recycling bins for each household. It will look at offering larger bins for larger households and an extra collection for people with sanitary products or nappies. Tom Renhard, the Bristol city council’s Labour group leader, said: “Before you start considering whether to go to three- or four-weekly bin collections, there needs to be a focus on sorting out the existing service first and make sure that’s functioning as it should be.” He called for innovations such as a city-wide nappy recycling scheme and better measures to tackle soft plastic waste. Residents who have signed the Labour petition include Amy, who did not give her surname, who said: “It will increase rubbish on the streets and put families under pressure. Even if families recycle as much of their waste as possible, there are still a considerable amount of things that need to go in the black bin.” Explore more on these topics Bristol Local government Waste Green party Recycling England Climate crisis news Share Reuse this content",

He added: “I’ve worked at the BBC for 25 years now, on the radio, a lot of you may well have grown up listening to me. I’m sure a lot of you will not have much idea about me at all. “Either way, if you could make me part of your morning routine, it would honestly mean so much because, believe me, I’m going to give it absolutely everything I’ve got.

Photograph: Kristian Buus/10:10/PA Energy industry Good Energy agrees near-£100m takeover by UAE-linked firm Esyasoft to acquire UK company, which supplies renewable power to about 245,000 households and businesses Business live – latest updates Jasper Jolly Mon 27 Jan 2025 10.40 GMT Last modified on Mon 27 Jan 2025 12.39 GMT Share A British green electricity supplier, Good Energy, has agreed a near-£100m takeover by a company controlled by a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family. The retail energy company said on Monday it had agreed a deal with the Dubai-headquartered Esyasoft for a cash offer of £4.90 a share, valuing it at £99.4m. The share price of Good Energy, listed on London’s junior Alternative Investment Market, rose by a fifth on Monday to £4.78. The offer was two-thirds higher than Good Energy’s share price on the day before Esyasoft’s interest was first revealed in October . Good Energy serves about 245,000 household and business customers in the UK, providing 100% renewable electricity as well as specialising in letting users sell solar power back to the grid. It also installs solar panels and heat pumps. Esyasoft is ultimately controlled by the Abu Dhabi International Holding Company (IHC), the investment company chaired by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the son of the United Arab Emirates’ founder, and part of the Abu Dhabi ruling family. IHC owns companies involved in oil and gas drilling and distribution, including servicing the huge growth of the US shale gas industry. However, IHC also counts solar power among its investments, and Esyasoft focuses on power distribution technology. The takeover would give a windfall to the energy entrepreneur and Labour donor Dale Vince , whose holding company Green Britain Group is the largest shareholder in Good Energy, with a 26% stake. Good Energy was co-founded in 1999 by Martin Edwards and Juliet Davenport, who left the company in 2021 and offered her backing for the deal. The investment would give the “opportunity to scale the Good Energy propositions” and “make a real difference to climate change”, she said. Edwards has a 7.3% stake in the business, while Davenport holds 2.7% of the shares, according to Reuters. “I founded Good Energy 25 years ago to be a pioneer in the provision of clean power to all customers in the UK,” Davenport said. “The energy industry back then was very different, founded around fossil fuels and designed to be a centralised system.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the takeover goes ahead, Esyasoft said it would spend six months working out a long-term strategy for the company, but: “Good Energy Group would continue to operate in materially the same way without signiﬁcant disruption to its business or operations.” However, it also said it wanted to expand Good’s solar installation and maintenance business, sell its services internationally, and try to make the electric car charger app Zapmap profitable. Nigel Pocklington, who took over as chief executive from Davenport, said the deal would provide a “partner that shares our sustainable energy vision and has the resources to accelerate our purpose substantially”, including by operating in new markets in which Esyasoft already works.

Photograph: Yemassee Police Department South Carolina Last of 43 escaped US monkeys captured after months on the loose Monkeys lived in South Carolina woods for two months and were lured out with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Associated Press Mon 27 Jan 2025 13.16 GMT Share Authorities in South Carolina say that the last four of 43 escaped monkeys were recaptured after two months of living in the woods, weathering a rare snowstorm and being tempted back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did not fully lock their enclosure at Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research – known to locals as “the monkey farm”. The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, said Greg Westergaard, Alpha Genesis chief executive officer, in a statement relayed by the Yemassee police department in a social media post without further details. While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3in (8 cm). The rhesus macaques made a break for it on 6 November and mostly hung around near the facility. They are about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7lbs (3kg). Authorities said they were all back in captivity on Friday. It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecured. The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police. Facility employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as well as “monkey biscuits” – a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for rhesus macaques. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25m years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA. The compound is about a mile (1.6km) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80km) north-east of Savannah, Georgia.

The short video app has yet to appear on the tech companies’ app stores, reflecting an unease about the White House executive order that has given TikTok the confidence to resume operations after temporarily shuttering the service on 18 January. Apple and Google do not appear to agree. The legislation forbade companies from distributing, maintaining or updating TikTok – for instance, selling it on an app store – after a deadline of 19 January. But the executive order, signed within hours of Donald Trump’s return to the White House, suspended for 75 days enforcement of an act that demanded the Beijing-based owner of TikTok, ByteDance, sell the app’s US operation or face a de facto ban. Trump may smell money in saving TikTok, but there’s a whiff of platform power too | John Naughton Read more The order seeks to reassure companies that work with TikTok that they will not be prosecuted for keeping the social media app on US users’ smartphone screens. It also instructs the attorney general – who leads the Department of Justice (DoJ) – to issue a letter reassuring those entities that the law has not been violated and there is no liability for their conduct. Nonetheless, Apple and Google have taken TikTok off their stores, meaning US smartphone users cannot download it. In the rest of the world, the app is free to access as before. In China, ByteDance runs a sister app , Douyin. Oracle, the cloud computing provider that delivers the app’s content, has not pulled the plug in the US. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s founder and the world’s fourth richest person, with a $209bn (£167bn) fortune, has been suggested by Trump as a potential buyer of TikTok. Indeed, Ellison was present at a press conference last week where Trump suggested he buy it, saying it sounded like a “good deal” . On Saturday NPR reported that Trump was working on a deal to buy TikTok’s global operations that involved Oracle, although the president then pushed back on that scenario, saying he was not in talks with the company. “Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days,” he told reporters on Saturday. The YouTube star, MrBeast – whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson – has also expressed an interest . The Chinese government, which in the past has said a deal would require its approval, has indicated more openness to a transaction, with its foreign ministry saying companies should “decide independently” about their operations and deals. According to legal experts, Apple and Google have reason to be cautious. Saurabh Vishnubhakat, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law, says a court might tolerate a “temporary suspension” of enforcement but is less likely to accept a “wholesale repudiation” of the law. “Although the attorney general is free to declare what they think the law is – or what the president thinks the law is – it is ultimately for the courts to decide whether the law has actually been violated,” he says. The wording of the order – referring to the DoJ and attorney general only – could also raise concerns for third parties that work with TikTok, says another expert, by exposing them to the risk of legal action from non-state entities. “This means that parties other than the DoJ and attorney general, for example, privates, might be able to sue companies for non-compliance with the ban or divest mandate,” says Elettra Bietti, an assistant law professor at Northeastern University. The promise not to prosecute a company for breaching the legislation – offers “minimal security”, according to an article last week by Alan Rozenshtein, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota. Trump could also change his mind, as he has done over banning an app that he wanted to shut down during his previous presidency , and selectively enforce the statute against companies he falls out with, Rozenshtein added. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A private fundraising letter from AFP to its secretive list of donors, seen by the Guardian, outlines the organization’s strategy for the first six months of the new Trump administration . The eight-page document , made public here for the first time, promises a “herculean undertaking” in which AFP says it will press for renewed and deepened tax cuts and an “unwinding [of] as many of the growth and innovation killing regulations as possible”. The group, which has played a significant role in shifting the Republican party to the right in recent years, has announced a $20m campaign to extend the tax cuts introduced by Trump during his first presidency that are due to expire at the end of this year. The donor appeal calls for even bolder tax cuts for corporations that would directly benefit Koch Industries, the energy and chemicals giant from which most of AFP’s funding derives. AFP’s donor pitch, presented as a 2025 “prospectus”, outlines a vast “lobbying and grassroots effort” – replete with digital adverts, phone calls, social media posts, podcasts and on-the-ground door-knocking – to boost core Trump ambitions. As such, it speaks to the oligarchy of “extreme wealth, power and influence” coalescing around Trump, which Joe Biden warned about in his final address from the Oval Office. Trump’s inauguration on Monday gave tech billionaires including Elon Musk , Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos front-row seats. Charles Koch, one of the world’s richest people, is now joining the list of oligarchs seeking to enhance Trump’s second presidency in mutually-beneficial ways. Trump vows to ‘unleash’ oil and gas drilling as he rolls back climate rules Read more It is estimated that the Kochs, who own the US’s second-largest privately held company, have benefited by more than $1bn a year from Trump’s tax cuts. That bonanza would continue were the reduced corporate and income tax rates effected by Trump continued. Koch Industries, which includes major oil refining and distribution interests, also stands to profit from any curtailment of federal environmental regulations combatting the climate crisis. As one of his first acts back in office, Trump moved for the second time to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. “Koch Inc is primarily a fossil fuel company, so they are going to do very well under Trump,” said Arn Pearson, executive director of the progressive non-profit watchdog Center for Media and Democracy (CMD). CMD obtained the donors’ letter and shared it with the Guardian. AFP was founded in 2004 by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch (David died in 2019). It remains a key political advocacy group within the Koch network, with $130m of its $168m budget in 2023 coming from the Kochs through their main funding channel, Stand Together . Relations between Trump and Charles Koch have at times appeared to be strained. In 2018, Trump wrote on social media : “I don’t need their money or bad ideas,” referring to the “globalist Koch Brothers” whom he derided as “a total joke in real Republican circles”. Last year Americans for Prosperity Action, the Koch network’s Super Pac, supported Nikki Haley in the Republican primary race over Trump . But AFP went on to aid Trump’s bid for a return to the White House by running an intensive digital advertising campaign in swing states relentlessly and falsely attacking “Bidenomics” as the sole cause of inflation in the US. AFP’s prospectus suggests that whatever remaining animus that may exist between the two men has now been smoothed over. “Trump and Koch are working hand in glove transactionally to move the parts of the Trump agenda that the Koch network agrees with – and that’s a lot of it,” said Nancy MacLean, professor of history and public policy at Duke university. MacLean is author of Democracy in Chains that chronicles how the Kochs exerted their grip on US politics . The affinity of the two rightwing behemoths is amply on display in Trump’s cabinet nominations. Pete Hegseth, the newly-confirmed defense secretary, is former chief executive of Concerned Veterans for America, a non-profit group wo...",

Palestinians displaced from their homes in northern Gaza began to return to the region early on Monday, the territory’s interior ministry said, after the first major crisis of the truce between between Israel and Hamas. The mediating party, Qatar, said the two sides had reached an agreement over the release of an Israeli civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, who is to be freed along with two other hostages before Friday. The deal meant that on Monday, Israeli authorities allowed Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. Social media showed thousands of people walking along sandy roadways surrounded by the total destruction of more than a year of Israeli strikes. Learning they could begin to move north on Monday, displaced families broke out in cheers. “No sleep, I have everything packed and ready to go with the first light of day,” Ghada, a mother of five, told Reuters. What has Donald Trump said about Gaza?

Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP Donald Trump acted in “clear violation of the law” by firing more than a dozen independent federal government inspectors, US senator Adam Schiff has said, his voice joining a chorus of criticism against the sweeping actions taken by the president in his first week. “Yeah, he broke the law,” the California Democrat said Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. “And not just any law – but a law meant to crowd out waste, fraud and abuse.” Trump dismissed the inspectors general at agencies including the departments of state, defense and transportation with immediate effect by email late on Friday. But federal law requires the president to give both the House and Senate reasons for the dismissals and 30 days’ notice. What have others said about the firings? Republican senator Lindsey Graham brushed off their unlawfulness. He acknowledged that Trump violated the law (telling Meet the Press that “technically yeah”, he did), before adding: “I’m not losing a whole lot of sleep that he wants to change the personnel out.” Immigration raids in Chicago begin as Trump directs Ice to increase arrest rate to hit quota of 1,500 daily View image in fullscreen Anti-Trump protesters gather in Federal Plaza to rally on the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday in Chicago, Illinois. Photograph: Erin Hooley/AP Authorities have started deportation raids in Chicago , an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) statement confirmed Sunday, days after the incoming “border czar”, Tom Homan, claimed officials were “reconsidering” after details about the raids were leaked. Trump administration officials have said the city, home to many of the state’s estimated 400,000 undocumented people, would be the epicenter of immigration enforcement actions. The raids came after the Washington Post reported that the Trump administration has directed Ice to ramp up their daily arrests from a few hundred to 1,200 to 1,500. Citing four people close to the proceedings, the outlet reported that Trump was unhappy with the pace of deportations so far, and wanted Ice field offices to make 75 arrests daily. Ice managers are to be held accountable for quota targets, it reported. What new powers does Ice have? Trump last week issued an executive order allowing immigration enforcement action at locations such as schools and churches, where it had previously been blocked. How are undocumented people responding? Many are believed to have stayed home to avoid possible interactions with federal law enforcement.

Composite: Getty Blake Lively Intimacy coordinators say Blake Lively’s legal dispute shows need for their role Actor has accused Justin Baldoni, co-star and director of It Ends With Us, of sexual harassment in civil action Nadia Khomami Arts and culture correspondent Mon 27 Jan 2025 10.28 GMT First published on Mon 27 Jan 2025 05.00 GMT Share The film footage at the centre of Blake Lively’s high-profile legal row proves that intimacy coordination should be considered as necessary on set as organising stunts, leading consultants have said. Lively filed a civil complaint against co-star and director Justin Baldoni shortly before Christmas, accusing him of sexual harassment during the filming of It Ends with Us – a romantic drama released last year. Baldoni denies the claims. His legal team retaliated by releasing a video of the pair going through three takes of one scene in which the pair slow-dance in a bar, which is alleged by Lively in her lawsuit to be an example of his inappropriate behaviour. But while his lawyers claim the video exonerates him, Lively’s team said it further proved she felt uncomfortable in scenes that she said had not been choreographed. Intimacy coordinators say the myriad allegations and counter-allegations show the importance of having a professional on set to mediate intense scenes with complicated power dynamics. ‘It’s a PR battle’: inside the Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni lawsuits Read more “Dancing can absolutely be intimate, and having an intimacy coordinator on set should be a given,” Ita O’Brien, who pioneered the role, told the Guardian. She added: “In the past, some people would go, ‘I do my own stunts. I don’t need a stunt coordinator’. Whereas today, if there’s a stunt or a fight, you have a stunt coordinator there to offer their skills. It should now be the same with intimacy coordinators.” The video depicted Lively and Baldoni discussing how they spend time with their spouses and joking about the size of Baldoni’s nose. Baldoni’s team say it provides context to Lively’s allegation that Baldoni told her she smelt good, showing the comment to be in response to Lively talking about her spray tan. But Lively’s legal team called the video “damning” and said it showed Baldoni repeatedly “attempting to kiss” her, “rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her … and talking with her out of character”. Justin Baldoni sues Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds for $400m Read more They alleged every moment was improvised by Baldoni “with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present”. On Thursday, Mia Schachter, an intimacy coordinator on Apple TV+’s Lessons in Chemistry and HBO’s Insecure, told the Hollywood Reporter she could see Lively trying to “appease” Baldoni and “keep a smile on her face”. Arielle Zadok, an intimacy coordinator and sex educator, claimed it was clear the actors were “negotiating the scene in real time”, when an intimacy coordinator would have handled everything in advance. She added: “This is an instance where I definitely would have had a conversation with Blake to check in on what I was picking up, ask the director for more clarity on the specific beats and make sure everyone was clear and confident prior to doing another take.” Zadok said it was also important to note that “the inherent power dynamic between actor and director is glaringly obvious”. O’Brien, who has worked on dozens of hit films and TV shows, said in general she urged actors “not to bring their personal and private life into their character’s physicality” because the two “should never be confused”. Tommy Ross-Williams, the chair of the Bectu trade union’s intimacy coordinators branch and intimacy coordinator on Sky Atlantic’s Sweetpea , said “many important lines are blurred” when actors tried to negotiate the scope of an intimate scene while performing. “The lines between what is happening in-character versus out, what are differences of creative vision versus expressions of personal boundaries, as well as the lack of distinction between when Mr Baldoni is acting as co-star to Ms Lively versus as the film’s writer/director (and her employer),” they said. Asked how an intimacy coordinator would approach a romantic dance scene, O’Brien said: “It starts with reading the script and interrogating why the scene is in the story. “From that conversation will emerge the physicality. We always invite the director to think about what they really want to capture. We gain agreement and consent for every beat – whether that’s fingers intertwining, a hand around the back of a neck, or fingers running through someone’s hair.” The intimacy coaches interviewed acknowledged they were not physically present on set and...",

        "summary": "The Bank of Canada will contend with a looming hit to Canada's economy from Donald Trump's threatened tariffs as it prepares for an interest rate decision this year.",
        "full_content": "The Bank of Canada is being pulled in a few different directions ahead of its first interest rate decision of the year on Wednesday. On one hand, there are signs of trouble bubbling up in underlying inflation that could make an argument for keeping borrowing costs higher for longer. On the other: fears of a trade war with the United States. President Donald Trump has reiterated threats to impose tariffs of 25 per cent on Canadian goods that could be set to take effect mere days after the central bank’s rate decision. “If Trump were to carry out those 25 per cent tariffs, and they were in place for some time, unfortunately a recession in Canada would be inevitable,” says Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics. A trade blow like that would normally push the Bank of Canada towards steeper rate cuts in a bid to salvage economic growth. But dropping rates too quickly at a time when the loonie is already struggling risks fuelling more inflation on imports from south of the border. Story continues below advertisement 5:27 Looming Tariff Battle and Its Impact on Canadians What’s a central bank to do? Economists who spoke to Global News say they’re betting the Bank of Canada will go ahead with another cut to its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, albeit a smaller one than in the central bank’s recent outings. Markets expect another cut The Bank of Canada’s benchmark interest rate broadly sets the cost of borrowing across the country and acts as a signal for rates Canadian gets on key loans like home mortgages. Story continues below advertisement The central bank has cut its policy rate a total of 1.75 percentage points in five consecutive decisions, trimming by 50 basis points in October and December amid signs of weakness in the economy and growing fears that inflation could drop too far below the two per cent target.

After moving quickly to lower the rate in 2024, Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem signalled after the most recent rate decision last month that monetary policymakers may adopt a more “gradual pace” of easing in 2025. Brown questions whether the Bank of Canada needed to move as quickly as it did in its most recent decisions amid signs the economy likely accelerated heading into the end of 2024 as previous rate cuts started to provide a pick-up in growth. Inflation has meanwhile remained largely under control, cooling to 1.8 per cent in December , thanks in no small part to Ottawa’s GST/HST “holiday.” But economists have noted the three-month moving averages of so-called “core inflation” are holding stubbornly above three per cent. Story continues below advertisement 1:53 Inflation slows ahead of Bank of Canada’s 1st interest rate decision of 2025 Cutting interest rates further right now also risks driving the already-weak loonie even lower amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will pause its own rate cuts this week. A weaker Canadian dollar can also fuel inflation by making imports more expensive. Benjamin Reitzes, BMO’s managing director of Canadian rates and macro strategist, says the inflation data alone does not make the argument for another interest rate cut at the Jan. 29 meeting.

During the announcement, Ford confirmed long-rumoured plans that he would trigger a provincial election within days and repeatedly attacked his political opponents, asking Ontarians to vote for the Progressive Conservative Party. In the background, Ford’s words were met with applause and shouts of encouragement from an audience of non-political city workers who Global News can reveal were ordered to turn up. Staff were also armed with pamphlets and posters celebrating the light rail route promise, and were praising Ford by name, thanking him for the promised spending.

Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said it was “a completely inappropriate use of non-political staff” … “yet another example of how Doug Ford cares more about his image than he does about the people of this province.” “Ontarians are tired of a government that puts partisan politics before everyday people,” Schreiner said in a statement.

        "full_content": "The FBI has arrested and charged a former top UN agency executive from Montreal for allegedly attempting to broker more than $1 billion worth of illicit arms deals between China and Libya, Global News has learned. “James” Kuang Chi Wan, who was a deputy director at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), was apprehended by the FBI after he stepped off a flight from Taiwan that landed at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Jan. 21, 2023, FBI documents show. Wan, 62, allegedly spearheaded a scheme to help the People’s Republic of China (PRC) sell $1.54 billion of drones, missiles and even shoulder-fired missiles to armed militants in Libya between 2019 and 2023, according to an FBI search and arrest warrant and criminal complaint attached as an exhibit. The U.S. Department of Justice charged Wan, whose principal residence is in Montreal, with breaching the U.S. Arms Export Control Act after the FBI uncovered evidence suggesting he allegedly benefited financially from the scheme. The FBI’s criminal complaint against Wan alleges that he and six co-conspirators, including one Canadian, were involved in the multinational operation. The six others were not named. Wan said one participant was “a special advisor to Chinese President Xi Jinping,” according to the FBI documents. The criminal complaint filed against Wan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York two years ago remains sealed from the public. Global News obtained a copy of it from an unsealed search warrant file. The FBI investigator leading the probe, counterintelligence special agent Gary Phillips, alleged that between 2019 and late 2022, Wan engaged in developing illicit arms and oil deals between the PRC, Libyan warlords and other officials in several Middle Eastern and North African countries. His activities were allegedly in violation of UN-imposed international arms embargoes and trade sanctions against Libya and others, the FBI documents contend.

None of the evidence cited in the FBI complaint and RCMP affidavits has been tested in a public court setting. Wan’s arrest is the latest in a growing list of FBI cases that highlight alleged misdeeds by People’s Republic of China agents or intermediaries that are landing before U.S. criminal courts, including political interference in the New York governor’s office, a spy inside telecom giant Verizon and secret Chinese Communist Party police stations in New York City. Wan's fate unknown Since the FBI took Wan into custody and seized his phone, laptop and storage devices, his fate before U.S. courts remains unclear. Wan could not be reached for comment. The FBI didn’t return phone messages. The RCMP would not comment on Wan’s status. “He is not accused by the RCMP, and the information you are seeking is related to the FBI investigation. Therefore, we cannot provide any information,” an RCMP spokesperson said. Wan’s wife, Ning Lu, declined to accept a letter from Global News through an intermediary seeking comment from her on her husband’s situation. The intermediary, who lives in Montreal, said, “She thinks your article does not help her family. So less stress is better for her.” A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice’s International Law Enforcement division declined to comment on Wan’s FBI airport encounter or current legal status. In the U.S., persons who breach arms export control laws may get up to 20 years in jail and a $1-million fine. In Canada, the maximum is 10 years in jail and a $100,000 fine. How the plot allegedly began Arriving in Canada in 2009 from Austria as a second-time newlywed, Wan was hired at the International Civil Aviation Organization headquarters in Montreal in its administration bureau. ICAO is the UN agency that co-ordinates global commercial aviation matters, including policies, safety regulations and standards, and training for its 150 member nations. The International Civil Aviation Organization headquarters near Old Montreal. Canadian Press The alleged conspiracy involving Wan, other ICAO workers and Chinese government officials began in December 2018, the FBI complaint states. That’s when an ICAO colleague, Mahmoud Mohamed Sayeh, allegedly approached Wan to act as an intermediary between China and the militant armed Libyan group led by warlord Khalifa Haftar, according to the FBI criminal complaint and unsealed RCMP affidavits. The RCMP says it issued an international arrest warrant for Mahmud Mohamed Elsuwaye Sayeh. He is facing conspiracy charges, laid in 2024, for allegedly illegal activities committed while he worked at the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN agency in Montreal.

        "full_content": "Alberta’s minister of health says it contains “a broad range of perspectives” — comprised of health care professionals, academics, researchers and advisers,” and its recommendations offer a perspective on how the government can be better positioned to protect the health and safety of Albertans in the future.” Critics call it “a sad document — that lacks significant credibility,” one that “takes a lot of pieces of information completely out of context.” On Friday afternoon, the government of Alberta quietly released the report of a task force, that assessed the province’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic . The report — with a budget of $2 million — was commissioned shortly after Danielle Smith swept to power in late 2022, promising to redress the COVID-19 grievances of her supporters. View image in full screen Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, swept to power, promising to address the COVID-19 grievances of UCP members. Global News The task force was chaired by Dr. Gary Davidson, a former chief of emergency medicine at Red Deer Hospital, who, during the height of the pandemic, accused the province of exaggerating COVID-19’s impact, saying the number of hospital admissions were overblown – being manipulated to justify public health restrictions. Story continues below advertisement Smith defended Davidson’s appointment saying she wanted to hear a wide range of viewpoints, including from those “shouted down in the public sphere.’ Amongst the other dozen members of the task force was, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, an outspoken critic of American Covid-19 policies, and President Donald Trump’s choice to run the U.S. National Institute of Health. But Dr. Brian Conway, Medical Director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Center, criticized the document saying, “this is a report that is written by individuals who clearly had an agenda, who did not want it to be peer review.” “Deena Hinshaw (former Alberta Chief Medical Officer) is not involved even as a contributor and as someone who would comment on the report — and she’s the one leading all of the decisions that are made in Alberta. How can you write a report about what happened in Alberta without Deena Hinshaw,” asked Conway. View image in full screen Critic’s of the Alberta government’s Covid-19 task force, point out that former Chief Medical Health Officer, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, who headed up the province’s pandemic response, wasn’t even interviewed for the report. Global News “Some of the key decision makers, who are not in government, but apparently even within government, wouldn’t talk to the task force because I think they felt — and rightly so — that the deck was already stacked against them,” said Mount Royal University Political Science Professor, Dr. Duane Bratt. Story continues below advertisement “I think that’s what’s happened here. Like it was a group of people who are selected, who are already known in the public domain to have extreme or fringe views about things like vaccination and about things like, you know, restrictions, public health restrictions,” said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist from the University of Alberta.

The report is 269 pages long and contains a long list of grievances over the province’s pandemic response. Among the report’s findings and recommendations: It says Alberta should refrain from future mask mandates for respiratory illnesses because, “there is no benefit for masking asymptomatic individuals,” and cites potential harms of masking, such as self-contamination, discomfort, and a false sense of security”; It criticizes the use of lockdowns to control the spread of the disease saying “the stringency of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical measures) had a small relative effect on the growth of infections”; It says rapid tests with reasonable accuracy should not be used for screening the general population and “future pandemic responses should prioritize minimizing severe disease and mortality over extensive case detection,” It promotes herd immunity or “infection-acquired immunity” that it says is “poorly understood” — noting that during the Athenian plague of 430 B.C. recovered individuals “were never attacked the same way twice – never at least fatally.” It says there needs to be more protection of physicians’ right to prescribe and a pharmacist’s ability to promote alternative treatments such as Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine, that, in their professional judgment — are in a patient’s best interest; and, It recommends the Alberta government immediately halt the use of all COVID-19 vaccines without full disclosure to patients regarding both the safety and efficacy issues by their physician, saying based on evidence that has emerged to date — most of which w...",

On Tuesday, council tasked city staff to develop a policy banning these programs from operating on public or private property in the city. “This is a really novel decision. Port Moody is the first municipality to pass a vote like this,” said Nadia Xenakis, a wild animal specialist with BC SPCA. “(The events) are usually targeted towards children and families where there are live animals present; often they’re exotic animals, wild animals from another country that are brought into Canada.” 2:09 Woman’s trail cameras capture amazing footage of B.C. wildlife The proposed policy is also winning approval from Vancouver Humane Society.

Not everyone agrees, however. Story continues below advertisement “I am very disappointed with the whole situation. Banning education, to me, is just wrong,” said Mike Hopcraft, owner of Wild Education BC, a reptile-focused rescue centre that also offers mobile presentations and in-house tours. “We’re not out there exploiting animals. We’re not breeding and selling animals as they think we’re doing. We are out there teaching people about the animals so that we hopefully don’t get as many resources in. That’s our big thing, education, and they want to stop that.” 1:03 Cougar sighted checking out B.C. backyard Trending Now ‘Heil Tesla’: Elon Musk’s salute projected onto carmaker’s factory in Germany ‘Potentially dangerous’: health experts call Alberta covid report ‘an attempt to rewrite history’ Wild Education BC, based in Langley, took in more than 150 animals last year including tarantulas, tortoises, snakes and other reptiles. Select animals in their care often interact with the public through mobile presentations and in-house tours. “(We’re) the largest reptile rescue in Western Canada. Most of the time, we are the only option out there for these animals,” Hopcraft said. “If city council gets their way and they ban these presentations, that takes away a huge portion of our income to take care of those animals.” Story continues below advertisement Hopcraft says every animal at Wild Education BC is legal in the province without a permit, but he agrees some should not be household pets. “There are a lot of rules that don’t make a lot of sense in this province when it comes to animals. I wish they would consult people like us more when making rules,” Hopcraft said. “I am terrified,” he added. “There could be a time very soon where everything we do is illegal, and then there’s the source of income gone for our animals, and then this rescue is gone.” BC SPCA hopes Port Moody’s decision encourages other local governments, and the provincial government, to make similar changes to their policies and regulations surrounding petting zoos. 2:01 Wayward sea lion still on the loose around Vancouver Island lake",

The Manitoulin, a 663-foot (202-meter) Canadian vessel with 17 people on board, got stuck in the ice on Lake Erie on Wednesday after it dropped off a load of wheat in Buffalo, New York, and was heading back to Canada, the Coast Guard said. It was freed Saturday. The ship wasn’t damaged, and its crew is safe, officials said.

A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter was at the scene conducting flights to monitor the situation. A third U.S. Coast Guard ship was scheduled to arrive Monday, in case the Manitoulin remained stuck.

        "full_content": "South Korean prosecutors on Sunday indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on rebellion in connection with his short-lived imposition of martial law, a criminal charge that could incur the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. This is the latest blow to Yoon, who was impeached and arrested over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country into political turmoil, shook its financial markets and hurt its international image. Separate from criminal judicial proceedings, the Constitutional Court is now deliberating whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. Yoon has become South Korea’s first president who has been indicted while in office. He will remain jailed and be escorted from a detention facility to a Seoul court for hearings in the trial, which is expected to last about six months. Yoon’s defense team confirmed his indictment on a rebellion charge, calling it “the worst decision” by prosecutors who they sary are trying to curry favor with political forces who want Yoon’s exit. Story continues below advertisement “Today’s indictment of the president will remain as a shame in the history of South Korean prosecutors that they cannot erase,” Yoon’s defense team said in a statement. “We stress once again that a president’s declaration of martial law can never be rebellion.” Prosecutors indicted Yoon on charges that he directed a rebellion when he imposed martial law, according to local media. Repeated calls to prosecutors’ offices in Seoul went unanswered. Investigative authorities have alleged that Yoon’s imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion, because he staged riots with the purpose of undermining the constitution. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. By law in South Korea, the leader of a rebellion can face a life sentence or capital punishment. 1:54 South Korean police arrest impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol Yoon, a conservative, has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, calling his declaration of martial law a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly, which obstructed his agenda and impeached top officials. During his announcement of martial law, Yoon called the assembly “a den of criminals” and vowed to eliminate “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.” Story continues below advertisement After declaring martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon’s decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it.

The martial law imposition, the first of its kind in South Korea in more than four decades, lasted only six hours.

The excitement in Israel was palpable, with TV stations filled with live reports from smiling news anchors and reporters interviewing ecstatic friends and relatives of the hostages. The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the militant group. The fragile deal has so far held, quieting airstrikes and rockets and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory.

        "summary": "President Gustavo Petro agrees to accept deported migrants after Trump ordered 25% tariffs on all goods.",
        "full_content": "Colombia yields on US deportation flights to avert trade war 2 hours ago Vanessa Buschschlüter and Ian Aikman BBC News US Government Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted this picture on X on 24 January announcing that deportation flights had begun A looming trade war between the US and Colombia appears to have been averted after the Colombian government agreed to allow US military flights carrying deported migrants to land in the Andean country. The spat erupted on Sunday when President Gustavo Petro barred two military planes carrying Colombians deported from the US from landing. The Trump administration responded by threatening to slap punitive tariffs on Colombian exports to the US. President Petro at first said Colombia would retaliate by imposing tariffs on US goods, but the White House later announced that Colombia had agreed to accept migrants - including those arriving on US military aircraft - \"without limitation or delay\". The White House hailed the agreement with Colombia as a victory for Trump's hard-line approach, after the country's two leaders had exchanged threats on social media on Sunday. \"Today's events make clear to the world that America is respected again,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement. She added that the tariffs and sanctions which the Trump administration had threatened to impose on Colombia, should it not comply, would be \"held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honour this agreement\". She also said that President Donald Trump \"expects all other nations of the world to fully co-operate in accepting deportation of their citizens illegally present in the United States\". Trump's threat to Colombia sends a message A cornerstone of Trump's immigration policy is removing unlawful migrants from the US, with the promise of \"mass deportations\". Rapid escalation The row between Colombia's left-wing president and Trump escalated rapidly on Sunday. Petro, a keen user of social media, posted on X that he had \"barred US planes carrying Colombian migrants from entering our territory\" because \"the US can't treat Colombian migrants like criminals\". He demanded that the US put procedures in place for migrants to be \"treated with dignity\". He also said he was ready to send the presidential plane to the US to transport the migrants. Colombia has accepted deportation flights from the US in the past. In 2024, 124 planes carrying deported migrants from the US landed in the country. But President Petro appeared to object to the return of deportees on military rather than civilian flights - and to the way the migrants may be treated on those military flights. In his posts on X, Petro referenced a news video showing migrants deported from the US to Brazil, who had been handcuffed and had their feet restrained during the deportation flight. He said that he would \"never allow Colombians to be returned handcuffed on flights\". Reuters Donald Trump had ordered 25% tariffs on all Colombian goods Petro's refusal to let two US military planes carrying Colombian deportees to land triggered a quick response by Trump on Truth Social. \"I was just informed that two repatriation flights from the United States, with a large number of Illegal Criminals, were not allowed to land in Colombia. This order was given by Colombia's Socialist President Gustavo Petro, who is already very unpopular amongst his people,\" he wrote. Trump argued that Petro's denial of these flights had jeopardised the national security and public safety of the US. He said he had directed his administration to \"immediately\" impose 25% tariffs on all Colombian goods coming into the US, which he said would be raised to 50% if Colombia did not comply within a week. He also said he had imposed a travel ban and revoked the visas of Colombian government officials \"and all allies and supporters\". In his post, he warned that \"these measures are just the beginning\". Petro responded on X with a long, rambling but ultimately defiant post in which he  said he would match any US-imposed tariffs. \"Your blockade does not scare me, because Colombia, besides being the country of beauty, is the heart of the world,\" he wrote. Meanwhile, members of Petro's administration worked behind the scenes to defuse the row. In a late-night news conference, Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo announced that the two countries had \"overcome the impasse\" and that Colombia would accept returned citizens. While Murillo did not directly refer to the White House statement, according to which Colombia had agreed to allow US military flights to take the deportees back, he did not deny it either. The foreign minister reiterated Colombia's offer to send its presidential plane to the US to transport the deportees. While the Colombian concession seems to have averted the looming trade war, the US has said that visa restrictions on Colombian government officials would stay in place until the first planeload of deportees landed in C...",

        "summary": "Andrzej Duda says even if a peace deal with Ukraine is struck, pipelines to Europe should stay shut.",
        "full_content": "Poland warns against restarting Russia gas supplies 6 hours ago Oliver Smith & Faisal Islam BBC News BBC Poland's President Andrzej Duda spoke to the BBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos Poland's president has said that gas flows from Russia to Western Europe should never be restored, even if Russia and Ukraine reach a peace deal. Andrzej Duda told the BBC that the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which have not been used since 2022, \"should be dismantled\". This, he said, would mean the likes of Germany would not be tempted to restore Russian supplies to boost its own struggling economy . \"I can only hope that European leaders will learn lessons from Russia's aggression against Ukraine and that they will push through a decision to never restore the pumping of gas through this pipeline,\" he said. The Polish president, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, insisted that economic sanctions against Russia were working and European countries should resist pressure from companies to re-establish business links. The Nord Stream gas pipelines were built by Russia's gas giant Gazprom and run between Russia and northern Germany. Nord Stream 1 was shut down in 2022 and Nord Stream 2 was never used, following the invasion of Ukraine. Both were damaged by explosions in 2022. Gas prices in Europe surged after the shutdown and, in recent months, politicians from Germany's far right AfD party have suggested the Nord Stream gas pipes should resume operations. Germany will hold federal elections at the end of February. \"I believe the Nord Stream pipelines should be dismantled,\" Duda said. \"This pipeline causes a very big threat to Ukraine, to Poland, to Slovakia but also to other Central European countries.\" He added: \"It is a threat from the point of view of energy, from the point of view of the military but also it is a huge economic threat because it means a domination of Russia over Europe in the economic sense.\" On the prospect of a deal between Ukraine and Russia now that US President Donald Trump has taken office, Duda insisted that no peace talks could take place without the participation of Ukraine. \"I'm saying that in my capacity as president of the Republic of Poland, as a neighbour to Ukraine and also as president of a country who has had very hard historic experiences itself,\" he said. \"I'm speaking here and referring to World War Two and to Yalta where we were not included in those talks, where certain agreements were made beyond our heads and then we found ourselves behind the Iron Curtain, where, for almost 50 years, we were part of the Soviet sphere of influence,\" he said. Trump tells Putin to end 'ridiculous war' in Ukraine or face new sanctions 'War will last as long as Russia does': Ukrainian talk of victory fades as Trump returns Trump had previously said he would negotiate a settlement to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022 in 24 hours - he has since acknowledged it could take some time. Duda said it would be \"a violation of international law\" for Russia to be allowed to hold on to territory it has occupied in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has said he is prepared to negotiate an end to the war, which first began in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, but Ukraine would have to accept the reality of Russian territorial gains, which are currently about 20% of its land. Putin also refuses to accept Ukraine joining Nato, the military alliance of Western countries. Duda said: \"The international community cannot agree, and it is unacceptable that Russia would take certain territories of Ukraine and keep them by force. This is unacceptable. \"We must not let Russia win this war.\" Duda said Trump \"understands the region\" and US involvement would be key. \"President Donald Trump - as the leader of the most powerful country within Nato, as the leader of the most powerful economy - will be of key importance,\" said Duda. \"I am waiting peacefully for the first steps which will be taken by Donald Trump.\" War in Ukraine Russia Andrzej Duda Ukraine Natural gas",

        "full_content": "DeepSeek: Chinese AI chatbot sparks market turmoil for rivals 42 minutes ago Peter Hoskins & Imran Rahman-Jones Business & technology reporters Getty Images The surge in popularity of Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app DeepSeek has sparked a selloff of shares in major tech companies after it overtook rivals such as ChatGPT to become the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store. Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta were set to open down on Monday and the development knocked European share prices. The app has grown in popularity since its launch, challenging the widely held belief that the US is the unassailable leader in AI and prompting questions about the scale of investments US firms are planning. It is powered by the open-source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was developed for less than $6m - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals. But this claim has been disputed by others in the AI space. DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China. To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology. This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before. It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry. After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of \"performance on par with\" one of ChatGPT maker OpenAI's latest models - when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning. Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Donald Trump advisor Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as \"AI's Sputnik moment\", a reference to the satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement. DeepSeek's popularity has startled markets. ASML, the Dutch chip equipment maker, saw its share price tumble by more than 10% while shares in Siemens Energy, which makes hardware related to AI, plunged by 21%. \"This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index. \"So if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.\" And Singapore-based technology equity advisor Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could \"potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain\". But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development. \"We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage,\" its analysts said in a report. Last week, a consortium of US tech firms and foreign investors announced The Stargate Project, a company which is putting $500bn into AI infrastructure in Texas. Who founded DeepSeek? The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China. The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek. He reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China. Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import. Mr Liang was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang. In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy , Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model. \"We didn't expect pricing to be such a sensitive issue,\" he said. \"We were simply following our own pace, calculating costs, and setting prices accordingly.\" Additional reporting by Joao Da Silva and Dearbail Jordan.

One of Nigeria's biggest celebrity couples, Annie and Tuface got married in 2012 and had two daughters together. In a post on Instagram, the African Queen singer said they had been separated for some time and had taken steps toward a divorce. The post was later deleted but 2Baba then released a video to confirm that its contents were accurate. The singer is seen as being one of the pioneers of the Nigerian music scene that is now popular around the world, paving the way for musicians like Wizkid, Davido and Burna Boy. The couple had a star-studded wedding ceremony in 2013, an event which was widely followed in Nigeria even though it took place in Dubai. The star is still widely known as Tuface even though he announced in 2014 that he had changed his name to 2Baba. News of the separation has shocked fans and admirers across the continent as the couple had overcome previous problems and are one of Nigeria's longest-lasting celebrity couples. The former Plantashun Boyz member says he plans to hold a press conference to provide more details, adding that he is committed to sharing his perspective directly with his supporters and music lovers around the globe. \"I and Annie Macauley have been separated for a while now, and currently filed for divorce,\" he said in the Instagram post. In a bizarre twist, the post was deleted minutes later, followed by another saying the account had been hacked. But 2Baba then went live on his Instagram account to confirm his initial post about the separation. \"No-one hacked my account, I said what I said, I come in peace,\" he said in the video. The couple have also cut ties on social media, unfollowing each other on their respective platforms, backing the performer's statement about their split. In the video of his most popular song, African Queen, Annie played his love interest and it is believed that their relationship blossomed from there. Annie, an actor, recently trended on social media after she shared personal details about her marriage, including a miscarriage and struggles with her husband's other relationships, on the reality show Young, Famous & African.

The Central Election Committee stated on Monday that Lukashenko won 86.8% of the vote and that turnout was almost 87%. There were four other names on the ballot - carefully chosen to present no challenge to the current leadership - but no credible contenders were allowed to take part in the election, as all opposition figures are either in jail or in exile abroad. No independent observers monitored the vote, either. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the election had been a blatant affront to democracy, while German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock posted on X that \"the people of Belarus had no choice\". Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin - who has ruled Russia since 2000 - congratulated his close ally Lukashenko for his \"solid victory\". Peskov said Moscow believed that the Belarusian election was an \"absolutely legitimate, well organised, transparent election\" and slammed \"the voices that sound from the West\". The leaders of China, Venezuela and Pakistan also offered their congratulations to Lukashenko. Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya dismissed the election as \"yet another political farce\". She claimed victory in the 2020 election, in which she stood in placed of her jailed husband. Lukashenko mistakenly believed Tikhanovskaya would pose no challenge to him - but after she appeared to have won massive support, she was driven out of the country. No opposition now remains in Belarus, which has also shuttered all its independent media. On Sunday evening, Lukashenko told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg his opponents had \"chosen\" prison or exile. \"We never forced anyone out of the country,\" he said, adding that he \"couldn't care less whether [the West] recognises our election\". This will be Lukashenko's seventh term in power. He has ruled Belarus since 1994.

The Vezhen - a Maltese-flagged ship - is now anchored outside the Swedish port of Karlskrona. Prosecutors said an initial investigation pointed to sabotage. An inquiry has been launched involving Sweden's police, military and coast guard. Images shared by Swedish media showed that the ship appeared to have a damaged anchor. However, on Monday, Bulgarian shipping company Navigation Maritime Bulgare, which listed the Vezhen among its fleet, said one of the ship's anchors dropped to sea floor in high winds and that there was no malicious intent. On Sunday, Latvia's military reported that three ships were seen in the area where the damage occurred. Less than a month ago, Nato launched a new mission in the Baltic Sea in response to repeated attacks on underwater power and telecom cables – some of which have been blamed on Russia. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said her country was working closely with Sweden and Nato in response to the incident. The cable belongs to Latvia's state broadcaster, LVRTC, which said in a statement there had been \"disruptions in data transmission services\", but that end users would be mostly unaffected. Earlier this month, Nato launched its new Baltic Sentry mission, after several cables under the Baltic Sea were damaged or severed in 2024. Nato chief Mark Rutte said the mission would involve more patrol aircraft, warships and drones. While Russia was not directly singled out as a culprit in the cable damage, Rutte said Nato would step up its monitoring of Moscow's \"shadow fleet\" - ships without clear ownership that are used to carry embargoed oil products. Rutte said there was \"reason for grave concern\" over infrastructure damage, adding that Nato would respond to future incidents robustly, with more boarding of suspect vessels and, if necessary, their seizure. Finnish police said late last year they were investigating whether a Russian ship was involved in the sabotage of an electricity cable running between Finland and Estonia.

The feathers and blood stains on both engines of the Jeju Air plane were from the Baikal teal, a type of migratory duck that flies in large flocks, according to a preliminary investigation report published on Monday. The inquiry into the crash - the deadliest on South Korean soil - will now focus on the role of the bird strike and a concrete structure at the end of the runway, which the plane crashed into. The engines of the Boeing 737-800 will be torn down and the concrete structure will be examined further, the report said. The Jeju Air plane took off from Bangkok in the morning of 29 December and was flying to Muan International Airport in the country's south-west. At about 08:57 local time, three minutes after pilots made contact with the airport, the control tower advised the crew to be cautious of \"bird activity\". At 08:59, the pilot reported that the plane had struck a bird and declared a mayday signal. The pilot then requested permission to land from the opposite direction, during which it belly-landed without its landing gear deployed. It overran the runway and exploded after slamming into the concrete structure, the report said. Authorities earlier said that flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the plane stopped recording about four minutes before the disaster. Experts who had flown the same type of aircraft involved in the crash have also questioned the presence of the concrete barriers at the end of the runway - with some suggesting that the casualty toll would have been lower if they had not been there. The concrete structure holds a navigation system that assists aircraft landings, known as a localiser. South Korea's transport ministry had said this system could also be found in other airports in the country and even overseas. Last week, authorities announced that they will change the concrete barriers used for navigation at seven airports across the country. Seven airports will also have their runway safety areas adapted following a review. The preliminary report has been submitted to the United Nations' aviation agency and to the authorities of the United States, France and Thailand.

New Zealand has relaxed its visa requirements to allow tourists to work remotely while visiting the country in an effort to boost its tourism sector. Under the new rules, visitors can now carry out remote working for a foreign employer while holidaying in the country for up to 90 days, after which they could face possible tax implications. The country's government has said the move is aimed at making New Zealand \"more attractive to digital nomads\", referring to people who travel while working remotely. \"The change will enable many visitors to extend their stays, which will lead to more money being spent in the country,\" said New Zealand's Immigration Minister Erica Stanford. The government said the changes applied to all visitor visas, including tourists and people visiting family, partners and guardians on longer-term visas. It added that only remote work based overseas was allowed, while visitors whose employment required them to be in the country still had to obtain appropriate visas. New Zealand's tourism industry generates a revenue of almost $11bn, according to the government. Many other countries have introduced visa programmes for digital nomads over the past few years in an effort to appeal to a growing number of people seeking opportunities to travel while working remotely. The trend took off in the 2010s, mostly among young workers who were looking to escape their daily routine. It was further bolstered by the Covid-19 pandemic, when worldwide lockdowns led to a shift in attitudes toward remote work. Countries offering digital nomad visas include Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Spain and Portugal. But the presence of digital nomads in some places has also sparked debate. In the South African city of Cape Town , detractors say the influx of remote workers has led to an increase in costs. The influx of visitors to countries such as Spain and Greece have also fuelled heated protests against overtourism. Immigration New Zealand",

His ill-fated attempt to impose military rule plunged the country into an unprecedented political crisis and he becomes the first sitting president in South Korean history to be charged with a crime. The indictment comes after a court in Seoul rejected a request to extend Yoon's detention on Saturday, which meant prosecutors had to make a decision on whether to charge or release him before Monday. \"The punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally,\" Han Min-soo, a spokesman from the main opposition Democratic Party told a press conference. 'My country is in crisis': A divided South Korea grapples with Yoon's arrest Who is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's arrested president? How one man threw South Korea into a political crisis Yoon's legal team criticised the indictment and pledged to expose any \"illegalities in the investigation\". \"The prosecution has made a grave mistake, reducing itself to being the indictment arm of the CIO, and a tool of political interests,\" Yoon's lawyers said, referring to the Central Investigation Office for high-ranking officials. In South Korea, insurrection is punishable by life in prison or death. However the latter is unlikely, given that the country has not carried out executions in decades. Separately, the Constitutional Court has begun deliberations on whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. The impeached president has largely refused to co-operate with the criminal investigation over the martial law declaration. Yoon is set to stand trial along with his former defence minister and senior military commanders, who are accused of helping him plan and carry out the attempt to seize total power. In an unprecedented televised announcement on 3 December, Yoon said he was invoking martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea. At the time, the embattled leader was in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and several of his cabinet ministers were under investigation. The military announced all parliamentary activity was suspended and sought to impose controls on media outlets. The opposition's Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung urged people to protest at the National Assembly and asked his fellow lawmakers to immediately vote to repeal the order. Less than two hours after Yoon's declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered - including some from the president's party - voted unanimously to block it. Soldiers equipped with rifles were seen entering the parliament building through smashed windows as a dramatic confrontation ensued. Thousands of civilians gathered in front of the assembly and tried to block the soldiers. Yoon was was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties on 14 December. The affair has triggered South Korea's worst political crisis in decades and has polarised the country. Many of his hard-line supporters have rallied around him. On Friday, tens of thousands gathered to protest, demanding he be released and returned to office. If Yoon is removed from office, a presidential election would be held within 60 days. The prosecutors' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The South Korean president's martial law gamble backfired: What was he thinking?

Some of the last survivors will be joined by world leaders on Monday, to commemorate the 1.1 million people murdered there. The remaining survivors are now mostly in their 90s and this might be the last year any of them can attend. In just over four-and-a-half years, Nazi Germany systematically murdered at least 1.1 million people at Auschwitz, built in the south of occupied Poland near the town of Oswiecim. Auschwitz was at the centre of the Nazi campaign to eradicate Europe's Jewish population, and almost one million of those who died there were Jews. Among the others who lost their lives were Poles, Roma and Russian prisoners of war. By the time the Red Army cautiously entered Auschwitz on 27 January 1945, only about 7,000 prisoners remained. Tens of thousands of others had already been forced to leave on foot on \"death marches\" as the Nazis retreated west. Italian prisoner Primo Levi was lying in a camp hospital with scarlet fever when the Soviet liberators arrived. The men cast \"strangely embarrassed glances at the sprawling bodies, at the battered huts and at us few still alive\", he would later write in his Holocaust memoir The Truce. \"They did not greet us, nor did they smile; they seemed oppressed not only by compassion but by... the feeling of guilt that such a crime should exist.\" \"We saw emaciated, tortured, impoverished people,\" soldier Ivan Martynushkin said of liberating the death camp , external . \"We could tell from their eyes that they were happy to be saved from this hell.\" World remembers Auschwitz 80 years after liberation Russia focuses on Soviet victims of WW2 Holocaust survivors fear Europe is forgetting the lessons of Auschwitz What was the Holocaust? When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933 they began to strip Jewish people of all property, freedoms and rights under the law. After the German invasion and occupation of Poland in 1939, the Nazis started deporting Jewish people from the Third Reich to parts of Poland, where they created ghettos to separate them from the rest of the population. In 1941, during the German invasion of the USSR, the Nazis began their campaign of extermination in earnest. Nazis spoke about their invasion as a race war between Germany and Jewish people, as well as the Slavic population and the Roma.

Media caption, Explaining the Holocaust to young people Groups of German soldiers called Einsatzgruppen set out across newly conquered lands in Eastern Europe to massacre civilians. By the end of 1941, they had killed 500,000 people, and by 1945 they had murdered about two million - 1.3 million of whom were Jewish. Behind the lines, Nazi commanders were experimenting with ways to kill en masse . They feared that shooting people was too stressful for their soldiers, and so came up with more efficient means of murder. Experimental gas vans had been used to kill mentally disabled people in Poland as early as 1939. Poisonous fumes were pumped into a sealed compartment to suffocate those inside. By the winter of 1941, the Nazis had constructed their first gas chamber and crematorium at Auschwitz. Nazi leaders met in January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference to coordinate the industrial slaughter - what they called a \"final solution to the Jewish question\" - killing the entire European Jewish population, 11 million people, by extermination and forced labour. What was Auschwitz? Auschwitz was originally a Polish army barracks in southern Poland. Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939, and by May 1940 turned the site into a jail for political prisoners. The Nazi officer made commandant of the concentration camp, Rudolf Höss, brought the motto Arbeit Macht Frei - works sets you free - from another camp where he had worked, at Dachau in Germany. That infamous lie remains there to this day above the entrance to the camp that became known as Auschwitz I.

This became the site of the huge gas chambers where hundreds of thousands were murdered prior to November 1944, and the crematoria where their bodies were burned.

At the very top is the figure of a mother with her children. Down below, depicted in bronze, are real stories of human suffering. At the bottom of some steps burns an eternal flame surrounded by the names of Nazi concentration and extermination camps. Auschwitz, Sobibor, Belzec, Treblinka… Terrifying words synonymous with the Holocaust. Yet this is not a Holocaust memorial as such. Its official title is \"the memorial to Soviet civilians who fell victim to the Nazi genocide\". I listen to a tour guide as she tells a group of schoolchildren about the Treblinka-2 extermination camp. There the Nazis murdered up to 900,000 Jews. \"Treblinka-2 was a death camp where a large number of people were killed in gas chambers,\" she says, without specifying that most of the victims had been Jews. Russian President Vladimir Putin unveiled the monument last year on 27 January: a date with a double historical significance for Russia. On this day in 1944 Soviet forces broke the almost 900-day siege of Leningrad. Exactly one year later the Red Army entered the gates of the Auschwitz death camp . Getty Images Vladimir Putin, pictured next to former French president Jacques Chirac, attended the 2005 ceremony in Poland commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. This year he is not invited. It is because of the Red Army's liberation of Auschwitz that 27 January was later declared International Holocaust Remembrance Day. But when he opened the memorial to Soviet civilians, Vladimir Putin spoke not of the Holocaust, but of the \"genocide of the Soviet people\". He argued that the Nazis' aim had been \"to seize our country's rich natural resources and territories, as well as to exterminate the majority of its citizens\". It's not that Russia has gone silent on the Holocaust. In the run-up to the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, there have been several Holocaust-related events across the country. And in a message to mark the 80th anniversary, President Putin wrote: \"In January 1945 the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz concentration camp and revealed to mankind the truth of the crimes of the Nazis and their accomplices who exterminated millions of Jews, Russians, Roma and representatives of other nationalities.\" But in Russia today there is a discernible shift in focus, away from the Holocaust to how the Soviet people as a whole, including Russian people, suffered in World War Two. More than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Patriotic War. Getty Images A Russian army doctor examines a survivor of Auschwitz after the Red Army liberated the camp in January 1945 This change in emphasis hasn't gone unnoticed. \"Nobody argues that there were millions of victims during the second world war,\" Israel's Ambassador to Moscow Simone Halperin tells me. \"But an industrialised plan to kill, eliminate, erase from the face of the earth a race: that was against the Jewish people. I think it is of critical importance to remember that the Holocaust was designed as the genocide of the Jewish people.\" \"It is not because [the Russian authorities] do not want to speak about the Holocaust or the Jews,\" suggests historian and researcher Konstantin Pakhaliuk. \"The idea is about presenting Russians as victims, to feel that we are victims: victims of Western powers, victims in history. That is the core idea of this narrative.\" Konstantin lives and works abroad. Back home he has been declared a \"foreign agent\", a label often used to punish critics of the Russian authorities. He argues that the narrative of Russia as victim has become especially strong since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine. \"If you are a victim, you cannot bear responsibility,\" Mr Pakhaliuk says. When Putin opened the memorial last year he focused on the 27m Soviet citizens who were killed during the war In the Soviet Union there was little public discussion of the Holocaust and what had been the systematic murder of European Jews by Hitler. On sites of mass execution of Jews by the Nazis, on Soviet territory, there were few monuments or plaques referencing Jewish victims. That began to change after the fall of Communism. Russian officials began to speak proudly of their country's historic role in defeating Hitler and saving the Jewish people from extermination. Twenty years ago President Putin was invited to Poland to take part in events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Speaking in Krakow on 27 January 2005 he noted: \"The Nazis chose Poland as the site of the planned mass extermination of people, above all, of Jews… we see the Holocaust not only as a national tragedy for the Jewish people bu...",

While the autonomous Danish territory has been quick to say it isn't for sale, its vast and mostly untapped mineral resources are in great demand. Jagged grey peaks suddenly appear before us, as the motorboat navigates choppy coastal waters and dramatic fjords at Greenland's southern tip. \"Those very high pointy mountains, it's basically a gold belt,\" gestures Eldur Olafsson, the chief executive of mining company Amaroq Minerals. After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold. It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles). \"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\" The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain. \"See here!\" says Mr Olafsson pointing to a seam of white quartz and a thin dark line. \"Gold, gold, gold. All the way over. Isn't that extraordinary?\" Four ways this Trump Greenland saga could go Trump threat casts ominous shadow over Greenland The mine, which Amaroq bought in 2015, had operated for most of the preceding decade, but closed due to then falling gold prices, and high operating costs. Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars. \"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson. He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched. \"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\" The mining facility at Nalunaq is based at a dramatic location Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island. Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources. It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt. There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out. Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\". He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies. \"You have a very strong China sitting very heavily on the critical raw materials,\" he says. Denmark boosts Greenland defence after Trump repeats desire for US control Up to Greenland to decide its future, Danish PM tells Trump Trump ramps up threats to gain control of Greenland and Panama Canal That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited. Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers. Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has \"absolutely increased within the last five years or so\". She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\" Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one. But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines. Current accommodation at the Nalunaq mine is very basic Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.

And the target wasn't China, Mexico or Canada - frequent subjects of his ire - it was Colombia, one of America's closest allies in South America. Colombia's offence was refusing to allow two US flights carrying deported migrants  to land because they were military, not civilian, transport planes. That was enough to prompt Trump to threaten to drop the hammer. \"We will not allow the Colombian government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the criminals they forced into the United States,\" Trump posted on his social media site. On top of the 25% tariffs he said he would impose, Trump said the US would introduce a travel ban and \"immediate visa revocations\" on Colombian government officials, as well as its allies and supporters. But later, the White House said Colombia had now agreed to accept migrants arriving on US military aircraft \"without limitation or delay\". As a result, the US will not go ahead with the tariffs. Colombia backs down on deportation flights For his first week in office, the US president had seemed to be prioritising executive action on immigration over trade measures - even if the latter were a key campaign promise. As if to drive that point home, Trump now appears ready to punish nations that he views as not sufficiently supporting America's new hard-line immigration polices. He is serving a warning to US allies and adversaries alike: If you don't co-operate with the US, the consequences will be severe. US Government Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted this picture on X on 24 January announcing that deportation flights had begun Colombia has backed down from a tariff war, but the tactic poses a test for the new Trump administration. If future sanctions lead to higher prices for US consumers, will the American public object? Will they be willing to tolerate some financial pain incurred to advance Trump's immigration priorities? The US imports about 27% of its coffee from Colombia, according to the US Department of Agriculture, as well as other goods like bananas, crude oil, avocados and flowers. The coffee imports alone are worth nearly $2bn (£1.6bn). Colombian President Gustavo Petro had initially responded by saying his country would accept repatriated citizens on \"civilian planes, without treating them like criminals\". It's no secret that Petro doesn't like Donald Trump – he's heavily criticised his policies on migration and the environment in the past. In a lengthy response on X, he said Trump would \"wipe out the human species because of greed\" and accused the US president of considering Colombians an \"inferior race\". Petro went on to describe himself as \"stubborn\" and said that while Trump could try to \"carry out a coup\" with \"economic strength and arrogance\" he would, in short, fight back. Most significantly, Petro said: \"From today on, Colombia is open to the entire world, with open arms.\" Six big immigrations changes under Trump - and their impact so far Surge of children crossing the Darien Gap jungle Millions more Colombians living in conflict zones This is something that should worry a US president who wants to tackle migration. His incoming administration officials have made clear that that mission will require looking beyond the Mexico border. Trump's pick for deputy Secretary of State, Christopher Landau, has long argued that  \"working with other countries to stop such migratory flows\" must be a \"global imperative of US foreign policy\". Sunday's spat might make working together a lot less likely. Tens of thousands of migrants every year from around the world, from India to China, head north towards the US after landing in South America and travelling up through Colombia across the Darien Gap – a key choke point just north of the Panama-Colombia border. It's a dangerous journey usually facilitated by criminal gangs. Reuters In his response to Trump's actions, President Petro noted that if talks over managing migration through Darien were suspended, \"illegal activities will increase\". Those comments could be viewed as a veiled threat of more undocumented migrants on the way. Petro was quick to say that his country would not refuse Colombian nationals deported from the US - only that they must receive \"dignified treatment\". Even after Colombia acted to defuse the row, it said a dialogue would be maintained to \"guarantee the dignity of our citizens\". But these kinds of tariffs are a test of will - and could still be applied to other nations that do not agree to the US's demands. From the looks of it, this is just Trump's opening move.

World's biggest hydropower project in the balance 14 hours ago Wedaeli Chibelushi in London and Emery Makumeno in Kinshasa BBC News Mbelechi Msochi Inga I and II were built in the 1970s and 1980s, while construction for Inga III was supposed to begin in 2020 From a set of roaring rapids, comes a grand vision. There are plans to build a magnificent, multi-billion dollar mega-dam on the Congo River - one that would produce enough renewable electricity to power vast areas of Africa. The structure would be called the Grand Inga Dam. Located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, it would have twice the power generation of China's Three Gorges and, therefore, be the world's largest hydroelectric plant. The Grand Inga Dam enticed investors and developers but decades after it was first dreamt up, the site reserved for the structure remains untouched. While DR Congo's government has insisted the plan is still in motion, critics point to the long delays, DR Congo's record of poor governance and the potential for serious environmental harm. There is also concern about the project's revolving set of international partners. Just last week, Chinese state-owned firm the Three Gorges Corporation, withdrew from the project, a source close to the partnership told the BBC. And then there is the eye-watering bill, which is reportedly as high as $80bn (£63bn) in a country that is one of the poorest in the world. But some believe the nay-sayers are holding Grand Inga to a different standard than other major infrastructure projects. And while construction has not begun, there has been  a flurry of meetings and discussions between interested parties over the past year. The need for the Grand Inga is certainly there. Roughly 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to electricity, according to the International Energy Agency, a global watchdog. It is a pressing issue - African heads of state, private sector figures and development partners are currently  discussing the issue at the Africa Energy Summit in Tanzania. Attempts to solve this problem date back decades. In the early 2000s DR Congo and its neighbours - South Africa, Angola, Namibia and Botswana - dreamt up an interconnected electricity grid. They looked to the vast Congo River, realising that its powerful waters have an immense hydropower potential. The international collective - known as Westcor - sought to multiply the two dams that already existed on the river - Inga 1 and Inga 2. DR Congo's long-time leader Mobutu Sese Seko oversaw their construction in the 1970s and 1980s, but by the end of the century, both dams were dilapidated due to a lack of funding for their maintenance. Westcor eventually disbanded but their Grand Inga dream lived on. Inga 1 and 2 now work at around 80% of their capacity and DR Congo has drawn up plans to supercharge this output, by adding six more dams along the river. These extra dams are forecast to generate up to 40,000MW of electricity at any one time - enough to power New York city during the summer. Through Inga, DR Congo will play its role as \"the trigger of the African revolver... a catalyst for the industrialisation of Africa,\" says the country's Agency for the Development and Promotion of the Grand Inga Project. The BBC contacted the agency for this article but it did not comment. Despite its previous projections that Inga 3 would be completed by 2018, construction has not even begun. The lack of visible progress suggests the project has stalled, but recent messaging from the World Bank - the world's leading development organisation - implies otherwise. Late last year, the bank announced it was back in talks with the Congolese government, having withdrawn its funding for Inga 3 back in 2016. The World Bank had cited \"strategic differences\" but eight years later - and with Félix Tshisekedi having replaced Joseph Kabila as DR Congo’s president - it has done a U-turn. “I think it’s the first time that I feel more optimistic. I almost believe that we can get it done,” Demetrios Papathanasiou, the World Bank's global director of energy and extractives, told a South African panel last February. This optimism seemed to be felt elsewhere, also. A pan-African alliance of finance institutions - including the African Development Bank - has recently been working together to help attract private investment to the project. The Grand Inga is like a \"serpent - it is up, down, visible, not visible,\" José Ángel González Tausz, chairman of AEE Power, a Spanish-run company and partner in the project, tells the BBC. In November, Fabrice Lusinde, the head of DR Congo's public electricity company Snel, said that if work on Inga 3 began in 2026, two of its turbines should be up and running by 2032. Electricity produced by these turbines would then finance the plant's other turbines, he said. On its own, Inga 3 is projected to produce 4,800MW of electricity. South Africa, a country hindered by regular power cuts , has signed a me...",

        "full_content": "Three children drown every day in India's wetlands. But mothers are fighting back 14 hours ago Soutik Biswas India correspondent • @soutikBBC Reporting from Sundarbans Swastik Pal Kakoli Das with a photographer of her six-year-old son Ishan, who drowned three months ago Mangala Pradhan will never forget the morning she lost her one-year-old son. It was 16 years ago, in the unforgiving Sundarbans - a vast, harsh delta of 100 islands in India's West Bengal state. Her son Ajit, just beginning to walk, was full of life: frisky, restless, and curious about the world. That morning, like so many others, the family was busy with their daily chores. Mangala had fed Ajit breakfast and taken him to the kitchen as she cooked. Her husband was out buying vegetables, and her ailing mother-in-law rested in another room. But little Ajit, always eager to explore, slipped away unnoticed. Mangala shouted for her mother-in-law to watch him, but there was no reply. Minutes later, when she realised how quiet it had become, panic set in. \"Where is my boy? Has anyone seen my boy?\" she screamed. Neighbours rushed in to help. Desperation quickly turned to heartbreak when her brother-in-law found Ajit's tiny body floating in the pond in the courtyard outside their ramshackle home. The little boy had wandered out and slipped into the water - a moment of innocence turned into unthinkable tragedy. Swastik Pal Every home has a pond used for bathing, washing, and even drawing drinking water Today, Mangala is one of 16 mothers in the area who walk or cycle to two makeshift creches set up by a non-profit where they look after, feed and educate some 40 children, who are dropped off by their parents on way to work. \"These mothers are the saviours of children who are not their own,\" says Sujoy Roy of Child In Need Institute (CINI), which set up the creches. The need for such care is urgent: countless children continue to drown in this riverine region, which is dotted with ponds and rivers. Every home has a pond used for bathing, washing, and even drawing drinking water. A 2020 survey by medical research organisation The George Institute and CINI found that nearly three children aged between one and nine years drowned daily in the Sundarbans region. Drownings peaked in July, when the monsoon rains began, and between ten in the morning and two in the afternoon. Most children were unsupervised at that time as caregivers were occupied with chores. Around 65% drowned within 50m of home, and only 6% received care from licensed doctors. Healthcare was in shambles: hospitals were scarce and many public health clinics were defunct. Swastik Pal Mangala Pradhan, whose son drowned in her home pond 16 years ago, now looks after children in a creche In response, villagers clung to ancient superstitions to save rescued children. They spun the child's body over an adult's head, chanting invocations. They beat the water with sticks to ward off spirits. \"As a mother, I know the pain of losing a child,\" Mangala told me. \"I don't want any other mother to endure what I did. I want to protect these children from drowning. We live amid so many dangers anyway.\" Life in Sundarbans, home to four million people, is a daily struggle. Tigers, known to attack humans, roam dangerously close to and enter crowded villages where the poor eke out a living, often squatting on land. People fish, collect honey, and gather crabs under the constant threat of tigers and venomous snakes. From July to October, rivers and ponds swell due to heavy rains, cyclones lash the region, and rampaging waters swallow villages. Climate change is worsening this uncertainty. Nearly 16% of the population here is aged one to nine. Swastik Pal More than a dozen mothers look after 40 children in makeshift creches called Kavach or armour \"We've always co-existed with water, unaware of the dangers, until tragedy strikes,\" says Sujata Das. Sujata's life was overturned three months ago when her 18-month-old daughter Ambika, drowned in the pond at their joint family home in Kultali. Her sons were at their coaching classes, some family members had gone to the market, and an elderly aunt was busy working at home. Her husband, who usually works in the southern state of Kerala, was home that day, repairing a fishing net at the nearby trawler. Sujata had gone to fetch water at a local handpump because a promised water connection at her residence had still not materialised. \"Then we found her floating in the pond. It had rained, water had risen. We took her to a local quack, who declared her dead. This tragedy has woken us up to what we should do to prevent such tragedies in the future,\" says Sujata. Swastik Pal Kakoli Das and her daughter Isha, who tragically lost their son and brother when he drowned while going to a neighbour Sujata, like others in the village, plans to fence her pond with bamboo and nets to prevent children from wandering into the water. She hopes that children who don't know how to swim are ta...",

Much of northern Gaza is now in ruins after Israeli bombardments. The Palestinians were due to return over the weekend, but were held up by a row over an Israeli hostage held by Hamas, Arbel Yehud . Hamas released four soldiers on Saturday, but not Yehud, a civilian - leading Israel to accuse Hamas of breaching the Gaza ceasefire deal. Yehud and two other hostages are now due to be freed on Thursday.

DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large-language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million. The developments have stoked questions about the large amounts of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers. watch now VIDEO 40:24 40:24 Why China's DeepSeek is putting America's AI lead in jeopardy TechCheck Takes U.S. technology firms plunged in Monday premarket trading, part of a global sell-off as Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked concerns over competitiveness in artificial intelligence and America's lead in the sector. Shares of chip designer Nvidia , a major beneficiary of the AI hype , slid more than 11% ahead of the market open. This rout extended to other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings , which each dropped more than 7%. Broadcom and AMD lost around 11% and 4%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout, each plummeted more than 15%. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International tumbled more than 7% and 11%, respectively, in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower . DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large-language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI's latest in many third-party tests. watch now VIDEO 3:07 03:07 DeepSeek rattles tech, but there's a lot we still don't know, says EIU analyst Squawk Box Europe These developments have stoked concerns about if the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers is warranted. They have also raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. \"DeepSeek clearly doesn't have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,\" said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could \"drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,\" a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, they said leading AI companies likely won't move away from the more-advanced GPUs. The recent announcement of President Donald Trump's $500 billion Stargate AI project is a \"nod to the need for advanced chips,\" they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for under just $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. They stressed that DeepSeek's models \"look fantastic,\" but shouldn't be thought of as \"miracles.\" And panic about the \"death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,\" they said, was \"overblown.\" Japan chip stocks fall as DeepSeek's challenge to U.S. AI dominance raises worries for Asian tech firms — CNBC's Lee Ying Shan, Alex Harring and Michael Bloom contributed to this story.",

The 232-year-old retailer said Monday that it was exploring the sale of its 520 high street stores, which sell newspapers, books and stationery. The move comes as pressure mounts on the high street retail industry amid the continued growth of e-commerce and higher employer costs. Members of the public walk past a branch of a WH Smith Plc in Orpington on January 23, 2025 in London, England. Dan Kitwood | Getty Images News | Getty Images British retailer WH Smith is looking to sell its historic high street business to focus on its travel store unit in the latest hit to the U.K.'s retail industry. The 232-year-old retailer said Monday that it was exploring the sale of more than 520 high street stores, which sell newspapers, books and stationery, confirming reports over the weekend that talks were underway. \"WHSmith confirms that it is exploring potential strategic options for this profitable and cash generative part of the Group, including a possible sale,\" the company said in a statement on the London Stock Exchange website. \"There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached, and further updates will be provided as and when appropriate,\" it added. WH Smith — part of the FTSE 250 — has been doubling down on its U.K. travel unit over recent years, with over 580 travel stores across airports, hospitals, railway stations and motorway service areas. Its wider global travel business totals 1,200 stores across 32 countries, which the company said now accounts for three-quarters of its group revenue and 85% of its trading profit. Investec's Kate Calvert said in a note Monday that the plans were \"not a surprise\" given the group's investment in its travel operations. In emailed comments to CNBC, Calvert added that WH Smith investors should be buoyed by the move. \"You own WH Smith for the Travel business. Travel is an attractive long term structural growth market. If you dispose of High Street, you should get a higher valuation rating over time,\" Calvert, head of retail and consumer research at Investec, told CNBC via email. Shares of WH Smith climbed around 5.5% following the announcement Monday, having fallen nearly 11% in 2024. They were last trading 2.9% higher. The move comes as pressure mounts on the U.K. high street retail industry amid the continued growth of e-commerce. Domestic policy changes have added to costs for U.K. business , with the government in October announcing increases to the U.K.'s minimum hourly wage and the National Insurance (NI) payroll tax paid by employers. High street supermarket chain Sainsbury's announced on Thursday that it plans to cut  3,000 jobs in the U.K. It follows warnings earlier this month from major retailers who cautioned that they could be forced to cut thousands of jobs this year to cover the cost of higher taxes, according to a survey by the British Retail Consortium. \"The Retail sector has seen unprecedented opex [operational expenditure] inflation in recent years from National Minimum wage and rates increases,\" Calvert said. \"Government increases in NMW & NI [national minimum wage and national insurance] are a huge headwind and very unhelpful. Retailers will need to close unprofitable stores,\" she added.",

Fernando Gutierrez-Juarez | picture alliance | Getty Images Cryptocurrencies tumbled to begin the final week of January, with the market in a cooling period after running to a new record and pulled lower by the DeepSeek-driven sell-off in tech stocks. The price of bitcoin fell 3% to $101,041.42, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it fell as low as $97,750.00. The broader market of cryptocurrencies, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 index, dropped nearly 6%. Nasdaq futures were down more than 3% in early trading. Shares of Coinbase and MicroStrategy fell about 2% each in premarket trading. Bitcoin miners that power AI ventures suffered deeper cuts. Core Scientific slid 18.5%, while Terawulf lost 8% and Iren , formerly known as Iris Energy, fell 10%. Crypto was under pressure from a rout in tech stocks. Chinese startup DeepSeek said it may have created a competitive artificial intelligence model for a fraction of the cost, sparking concerns about U.S. dominance in AI and big tech's spending on AI models and data centers. \"Today's 3% decline in Nasdaq futures (on DeepSeek news), so far, has driven Digital Asset liquidation overnight,\" Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick said in a note Monday. \"This relationship highlights the continued strong (and strengthening) relationship between digital assets and the tech sector. [Bitcoin] remains strongly correlated to Nasdaq, much more so than it does to gold.\" Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin falls under $100,000, dragged by DeepSeek stock sell-off Bitcoin has seen more than $250 million in long liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko , as traders who used leverage to bet the price of bitcoin would continue to rise were forced to sell their assets to cover their losses. The selling follows a mixed response by the market to President Donald Trump's widely anticipated executive order on crypto , issued Thursday afternoon, and a lack of news since. Some crypto traders were disappointed the order didn't fully commit to the establishment of a stockpile, and some didn't care for the \"stockpile\" language versus a reserve. (While the latter would involve actively buying bitcoin in regular installments, a stockpile would simply not sell any of the bitcoin currently held by the U.S. government.) Bitcoin hit a new record above $109,000 last week in anticipation of the executive order. \"Ultimately this set up digital assets to be more at risk of a sharp sell-off whether the driver of the sell-off came from digital assets or not (in this case Nasdaq),\" Kendrick said of the market's initial reaction to the order. \"Nevertheless, at least the Trump administration news is out there, so the disappointment/confusion and therefore 'hope phase' is over.\" Investors may also be derisking ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting, which is scheduled to conclude Wednesday. \"Investors are hoping the Fed will lean more to the accommodative side but are fearful the Fed won't be as dovish as what the market would like to see,\" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX. \"The most important takeaway right now is to see the forest through the trees. When we look at the bitcoin chart, there is nothing bearish about the price action.\" —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

John Macdougall | Afp | Getty Images Budget airline Ryanair on Monday reported stronger-than-expected after-tax profit for the December quarter, but once more cut its passenger traffic goal for the fiscal year to the end of March 2026 amid Boeing delivery delays. Europe's largest low-cost carrier posted after-tax profit of 149 million euros ($155.8 million) for the fiscal third quarter to the end of December, coming in comfortably above expectations. A company poll of analysts had anticipated 60 million euros profit for the three-month period, Reuters reported. Ryanair cited marginally higher fares due to stronger Christmas and New Year bookings, noting traffic grew 9% to 45 million passengers despite \"prolonged\" Boeing delays. The low-cost airline said that, while Boeing's 737 production is recovering from a strike at the firm in late 2024, Ryanair no longer expected the troubled U.S. planemaker to deliver sufficient aircraft to facilitate full-year traffic growth to 210 million passengers across the twelve months to the end of March 2026.

Sorahan said that Boeing appeared to have \"turned the corner,\" adding that he was hopeful Ryanair would not need to cut its traffic targets even further. Analysts at Citi said Ryanair's full-year capacity guidance is likely to \"create volatility\" in the firm's share price, \"but given it is an industry-wide issue, we think that it can be supportive for the pricing environment.\" Ryanair said it was \"cautiously guiding\" after-tax profit for the 12 months through to March 31 in a range of 1.55 billion euros to 1.61 billion euros, noting the outcome remains subject to the risk of conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East and to further Boeing delivery delays.",

Now many companies are increasingly building on that foundation to develop products that look to go beyond a chatbot. On the corporate side, Gartner research director Ben Yan estimates more than 10% of businesses in China are using generative AI, up from 8% about six months ago. \"We believe that China's AI sector is advancing at a pace comparable to that of the United States,\" Jo Huang, head of private equity at Raffles Family Office, said in an email. The World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on July 6, 2023. Aly Song | Reuters BEIJING — A slew of releases last week demonstrate how Chinese companies such as DeepSeek and ByteDance have moved quickly with artificial intelligence models that compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Now, many companies in China are increasingly building on that foundation to develop products that look to go beyond a chatbot. Baidu , best known for its search engine and Ernie chatbot , said Tuesday its generative AI-integrated Wenku platform for quickly creating powerpoints and other documents had reached 40 million paying users, with revenue up 60% from a year ago as of the end of last year. Updated features, such as using AI to generate a presentation based on a company's financial filing, started being rolled out to users in the last week. On the corporate side, Gartner data and analytics director analyst Ben Yan estimates more than 10% of businesses in China are using generative AI, up from 8% about six months ago. That would be a pickup in pace — the last 2 percentage point increase in adoption took more than a year, he said Wednesday. \"With our clients, we hear more and more success stories,\" he said in Mandarin translated by CNBC. Yan noted that so-called AI agents will help speed up corporate implementation of the new tech. watch now VIDEO 7:49 07:49 Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang on U.S.-China AI race: We need to unleash U.S. energy to enable AI boom Squawk Box AI models focus on specific functions such as search and generating summaries, whereas AI agents are more advanced — they can automate entire processes from searching to booking. One example is OpenAI's new \"Operator\" function that claims to be able to make restaurant reservations on behalf of a ChatGPT user. AI agents are also on the verge of coming to the Chinese market at scale. Tencent plans to soon integrate AI agents with its messaging and social media app WeChat, CEO Pony Ma told staff in a Jan. 13 speech, according to a copy of the annual address seen by CNBC. \"We believe that China's AI sector is advancing at a pace comparable to that of the United States,\" Jo Huang, head of private equity at Raffles Family Office, said in an email. She said the firm is considering investing in a leading China AI deep tech fund in order to capture the local opportunity. The development of Chinese AI applications creates features that are being integrated with domestic smartphones. Apple's AI intelligence functions have yet to come to iPhone users in China. \"There is also a shift towards a growing user preference for local brands that can offer advanced AI features tailored to regional consumer preferences ,\" Wei Sun, principal artificial intelligence analyst at Counterpoint Research, said in an email Thursday. She pointed out that Chinese smartphone companies such as Honor, Xiaomi and Vivo have been able to improve user experience of AI features, thanks to efforts to improve the efficiency of AI models that can run on the device without relying heavily on an internet-connected cloud service. Compliance hurdles The latest developments also reflect a difference in regulatory scrutiny with the U.S., and with the kind of technology being created. Baidu's ChatGPT-like Ernie bot didn't get Beijing's green light for a public rollout until August 2023 , nearly one year after ChatGPT took the world by storm. While AI models must get official certification for use in China, using them in applications is much easier, said Alex Lu, founder of Shanghai-based LSY consulting. On the side, he is working with a small team on an AI-powered tool for giving companies targeted daily insights on industry trends and global regulations, similar to the work of a human consultant. Half a year after development began in June 2023, Lu said the team began testing a product for free with potential customers, including a manufacturer of car batteries. That has provided the feedback for a product the team hopes to charge 70,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan ($9,660 to $13,790) in annual license fees, Lu said.

Employees move semiconductor testers on the assembly line of the Advantest Corp. plant in Ora, Japan on Aug. 10, 2012. Tomohiro Ohsumi | Bloomberg | Getty Images Japan's chip-related stocks fell Monday as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek challenges America's global leadership in artificial intelligence, threatening Asian tech companies part of the U.S. AI value chain. Shares of semiconductor testing equipment supplier Advantest , which counts Nvidia among its clients, fell 8.6%. Tokyo Electron dropped 4.9%, while Renesas Electronics fell 1.24%. Softbank Group , which owns chip designer Arm, plunged 8.3% after trading higher last week on CEO Masayoshi Son's plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. \"Japan's chip stocks are selling off sharply on the DeepSeek concerns and we are seeing a rotation out of growth names into value,\" Andrew Jackson, head of equity strategy at ORTUS Advisors told CNBC via email. Data center-related shares that were boosted by higher technology infrastructure spending will also be hit, he added. Shares of wire and cable firms Furukawa and Fujikura also fell 11.27% and 10.66%, respectively. The speed and focus of China's progress on chips is putting Japan's own ambitions into question, said veteran investor Jesper Koll. \"We know Japanese chipmakers are potentially world class, but we also know that their ability to produce at-scale is limited; and it is right to worry that their speed of execution may run behind China's newfound will to win,\" Koll told CNBC. watch now VIDEO 2:45 02:45 Upstarts developing AI using cheap chips could be game changer to tech: CIO Squawk Box Asia DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large-language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million. Last week, the lab launched r1, a reasoning model that surpassed OpenAI's newest o1 in several third-party tests. The fresh developments triggered concerns about the large amounts of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers. DeepSeek also had to contend with the tough semiconductor restrictions the U.S. government placed on China, limiting access to advanced chips. \"While it remains to be seen if DeepSeek will prove to be a viable, cheaper alternative in the long term, initial worries are centered on whether U.S. tech giants' pricing power are being threatened and if their massive AI spending need re-evaluation,\" IG's market strategist Junrong Yeap said in a note. DeepSeek has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's iPhone. The fall in Japanese chip shares comes as Nasdaq futures dropped 1.62% during Asia trading hours. \"Judging from the move in Nasdaq futures we may be in for a rough ride tonight in the U.S. also,\" Jackson added. \"With a model this cheap, many new products and experiences can now emerge trying to win the hearts and minds of the global populace,\" said Chamath Palihapitiya, Canadian-American venture capitalist and CEO of Social Capital said on social media platform X , who sees volatility in the stock market as capital markets will seek to re-price the values of the \"Magnificent 7\" companies. \"Nvidia is the most at risk for obvious reasons,\" he said.",

David Beckham opened up about the \"simple values\" his parents taught him that he passed on to his children, in a conversation with CNBC host Tania Bryer at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The former soccer star attended the WEF for the first time to receive the Crystal Award for philanthropy, for his work protecting vulnerable children as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since 2005. Bryer asked Beckham about where his passion to make a difference comes from and the values his parents taught him. \"I think they instilled in me the right values and it's the simple values of treating everyone the same and showing respect to people and I tried to do the same with my children,\" Beckham said. The 49-year-old father of four said his youngest, Harper, is 13 and his eldest, Brooklyn, is 25. \"My boys all know that they let a woman walk through the door before they do. They stand up when a lady leaves the table, they shake hands, eye contact. You know all of those values, their pleases, their thank yous. \"All of my kids have said pleases and thank yous from two, three years old. So it's the simple values that me and Victoria grew up with that we've tried to instill into our children,\" Beckham added. He said having kids has also inspired his work with children around the world. Beckham has traveled extensively to raise awareness about UNICEF's work with children . He has visited Cambodia to meet with children who were victims of violence and abuse, South Africa to meet families living with HIV and AIDS, and the Philippines, where he met with children who were affected by Typhoon Haiyan. \"I've taken a few of my kids on different trips. They know exactly the work that I do for UNICEF. They all want to get involved in the UNICEF work that I do. They all want to help in different ways and different charities. \"I continue to show them pictures upon pictures upon pictures when I come home from these trips, and it just gives them a sense of actually, what's happening in the world, and I think that's so important.\" In his awards ceremony speech, Beckham also emphasized that \"girls are held back\" by poverty, violence, and discrimination. \"I want my daughter Harper to have the same opportunities as her brothers, and that should be the case for all girls everywhere. Being a girl shouldn't determine what you can do, where you can go, and who you can become,\" he said. Beckham touched on several topics in his conversation with Bryer including his famed 20-year soccer career from 1992 to 2013, becoming the president and co-owner of soccer club Inter Miami CF, and his thoughts on social media .",

Allow your kids to invest in something low-risk at the start and ask them to explain their rationale, leaders told CNBC. Talk to children in their own terms, according to Singapore-based CEO Gregory Van. Ask: \"Do you want to spend $100 today on a toy, or have it turn into $200 in 10 years when you are 16?\" he said. Sally Anscombe | Getty Images Entrepreneur Eric Malka had to completely shift his mindset when he sold his company and became an investor. Since then he's learned many lessons he's now passing to his kids. When The Art of Shaving — which Malka and his wife Myriam Zaoui founded in 1996 — was bought by Procter & Gamble for a reported $60 million in 2009, Malka realized he needed to educate himself. \"When an entrepreneur like me is lucky enough to have a liquidity event, then we're faced … with managing assets without proper training,\" he told CNBC by video call. Investors must focus on being patient and on long-term returns, whereas company founders often look at a short-term plan, \"almost an opposite\" mindset, Malka said. He took courses on wealth management, read books on investing and now has a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, private equity and real estate, with about 10% allocated to riskier investments. In 2014 he founded private equity fund Strategic Brand Investments. The lessons learned when you lose are more valuable than the ones when you succeed. Eric Malka Co-founder and CEO, Strategic Brand Investments When it came to educating his children — sons aged 14 and 16 — about money, Malka's attitude has been to help them learn from the ground up. \"One of the challenges I faced with my teenagers early on, is their belief that it's very easy to make money by investing through social media and through what they hear from friends,\" he said. His older son thought he could generate a 20% monthly return, which Malka described as \"very concerning.\" So, Malka let him invest a small portion of his savings, hoping it would provide an opportunity to learn — and his son lost 40% of that investment after trading currency futures. \"I hate to set up my child for failure, but sometimes, you know, the lessons learned when you lose are more valuable than the ones when you succeed,\" Malka said. It's a point that resonates with Gregory Van, CEO of Singapore-based wealth platform Endowus. He and his wife have children aged eight, six and three. He said he'll be teaching them that it's important to make mistakes when the stakes seem large to them, though may be small in reality. \"The emotional muscle, and humility required to be a good investor is something that people need to develop on their own,\" he said. Teaching kids how to invest For Dayssi Olarte de Kanavos, president and co-founder of real estate company Flag Luxury Group, educating kids early about money is key. She and her husband allocated a \"low risk\" sum of money to each of their three children in middle school for them to pick companies to invest in. \"Our children chose Apple , Amazon , Google and Alibaba . All but one had terrific runs. As long as they kept their money in the market and continued to be thoughtful in their approach, we added every year to their nest egg,\" she told CNBC by email. Olarte de Kanavos said her experience in real estate investing taught her the value of patience. \"It influenced my business approach by emphasizing long-term strategy over quick gains,\" she said. The mother of three described her own investments in the stock market as \"very conservative, in order to best manage the huge risks that we take in our real estate business.\" Give them an allowance no later than the first grade. Dayssi Olarte de Kanavos President and co-founder, Flag Luxury Group She suggested having children explain why they want to buy certain stocks, because it \"can demystify investing and make it an exciting and integral part of their education,\" she said. Van said he talks to his young kids about the tradeoffs of investing in their own terms. \"I ask them: 'If we invest this $100 and it goes down by $70 next year, how will you feel?' 'Do you want to spend $100 today on a toy, or have it turn into $200 in 10 years when you are 16?',\" Van told CNBC via email. \"Surprisingly, they are very rational and always go for delayed gratification,\" he said. Van and his wife have investment portfolios for each of their kids, mostly made up of gifts they've received during holidays such as Chinese New Year. \"Given their long investment horizon, they are in very diversified, multi-manager, low-cost equities portfolios,\" Van said, and he shows hi...",

Reuters poll had estimated a reading of 50.1. China's industrial profits in 2024 fell 3.3% from the previous year, extending declines to a third consecutive year. \"The disappointing PMI data underscores the difficulty policymakers face in achieving a sustained recovery in growth,\" said Zichuan Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. Workers produce garments for export to overseas markets at Sihong Guoshun Garment Co., Ltd. in Weiying town, Sihong County, Suqian city, East China's Jiangsu province, on January 23, 2025.. Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images China's factory activity in January unexpectedly contracted, in part due to a slow season ahead of the Lunar New year, reversing the growth seen in the previous three months and keeping alive calls for stronger fiscal support to boost the economy. The official purchasing managers' index for January came in at 49.1, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday showed, compared with Reuters poll estimates of 50.1. PMI had stayed above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the past three months, coming in at 50.1 in December, 50.3 in November and 50.1 in October, according to the official data. The manufacturing PMI in January tends to be softer, as migrant workers return to hometowns ahead of the Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan. 29, said Hui Shan, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs. The blue-chip CSI 300 reversed gains earlier in the day to trade slightly lower, following the data release. Despite the softer manufacturing PMI, the overall demand outlook appears positive, said Bruce Pang, senior research fellow at the National Institution for Finance and Development, citing stronger readings in two price sub-indexes. The indexes measuring price levels for purchasing and selling major raw materials improved in January — albeit still in contraction territory — Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS said in a press release. A gauge of companies' production and operation activity outlook expanded to 55.3, Zhao added, showing that most manufacturers were increasingly confident about business expansion after the holidays. China's non-manufacturing PMI, which measures services and construction activity, fell to 50.2 in January, compared to 52.2 in the preceding month. The services PMI rose 50.3, less than the prior month, but still expanding given holiday-induced demand, especially in sectors benefiting from the seasonal travel rush, such as public transportation, hotels, food and beverage industries, NBS' Zhao said. The construction PMI fell to 49.3, as activity stalled in the lead up to the festival. \"The disappointing PMI data underscores the difficulty policymakers face in achieving a sustained recovery in growth,\" Zichuan Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. While the economic activity might pick up in the coming months as policymakers are likely to step up stimulus and front-load deficit spending at the start of 2025, the economy is still struggling amid the structural headwinds and tariff threats from the new U.S. administration, Huang said. Dwindling profits China's industrial profits in 2024 fell 3.3% from the previous year, extending declines to a third consecutive year. In December, however, profit jumped 11% from a year earlier , growing for the first time since July. watch now VIDEO 2:07 02:07 China's Lunar New Year travel expected to 'maintain strong momentum', says analyst Squawk Box Asia Corporate profits have been recovering from a sharp 27% year-on-year plunge in September — their steepest drop since March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. They had dropped 7.3% on year in November and 10% in October, as a slump in the real estate sector and bleak income prospects continued to weigh on consumer demand. Industrial profits are a key indicator of the financial health of factories, utilities and mines in China. The world's second-largest economy met official annual growth target last year , expanding 5.0%, as a barrage of stimulus measures kicked in. Economists had pointed to the industrial output growth outpacing retail sales , underscoring the country's supply-side strength while domestic demand remained weak. The manufacturers for consumer goods saw steady growth in their profits, increasing 3.4% last year from a year ago, NBS statistician Yu Weining said in a statement , boosted by policy incentives for consumption and strong exports.

Second winning week for U.S. stocks Major U.S. indexes retreated on Friday, but still ended the week higher , their second consecutive week of gains. The pan-European Stoxx 600 edged down 0.05%, but ended the week more than 1% higher . Burberry jumped around 10% on a shallower-than-expected dip in sales in the fiscal third quarter, while Ericsson fell more than 12% after the company missed estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings. New high for Alphabet Alphabet shares closed on Friday at $200 for the first time on a split-adjusted basis. The company implemented a 20-for-1 stock split in 2022. At that time, the stock was trading at about $2,750, equivalent to $137.50 after the split. Morgan Stanley analysts highlighted on Friday opportunities presented by Alphabet's artificial intelligence agent products. Mega Meta investment Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday announced the company plans to invest around $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025.

After the announcement, Meta shares closed at $647.49, a new all-time high. Trump's intentions with TikTok Trump is making a deal to save TikTok's operations in the U.S. , Reuters reported, citing two people with knowledge of the discussions. The sources said the deal would involve Oracle . However, in comments made to reporters on Air Force One on Saturday, Trump denied Oracle's participation, and said \" very substantial people \" are talking to him about buying TikTok. One of the parties could be Perplexity AI, which revived its proposal to ByteDance . [PRO] Earnings dominate week Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla announce their earnings on Wednesday, followed by Apple on Thursday — analysts think the reports could determine the direction of markets . Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its meeting on Wednesday, when investors will scrutinize Chair Jerome Powell's comments for hints on the path of interest rates. The bottom line The S&P 500 has been shuffling sideways since its post-election jump in November —in fact, it ended 2024 lower than where it was at in the beginning of December. There are signs the markets are finally awakening from their hibernation. While some of the Magnificent Seven stock struggled on Friday, both Alphabet and Meta Platforms ended the day at all-time highs on optimism around their AI offerings. And even though all major U.S. benchmarks slipped on Friday, they still ended the week higher for the second consecutive time. The S&P and Nasdaq Composite each rose around 1.7% last week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.2%. The S&P closed at a fresh high on Thursday and etched a new intraday peak during Friday's session. Impressively, it only took eight sessions for the index to rally from a two-month low to a record high, noted Sundial Capital Research founder Jason Goepfert. That rapid turnaround suggests that investors are growing convinced that the bull market is trotting back. Some of that sentiment can be traced to Trump's remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, such as his pledge to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately\" and comment that he would \"ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil.\" Lower interest rates, in general, boost economic activity, while cheaper oil reduces costs for businesses. But some analysts are worried investors might be cheering a mere phantom. \"So far, markets have reacted to every statement made by the President, even those that should not have any impact,\" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert. \"This shows that traders have not yet settled into their pace.\" Indeed, perhaps a more realistic sentiment of the markets can be interpreted from gold prices.

He has put forward a proposal for an American stakeholder to buy the company and then sell a 50% stake to the U.S. government, which will jointly run the app along with the private party. Trump reportedly said Saturday that he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and that he would likely decide on its future in the next 30 days. So, who are the likely contenders for one of the most popular apps in the U.S.? Elon Musk Trump has already flagged several major investors within his inner circle as acceptable buyers, one of which is Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk. The world's richest person is leading Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has close business ties to China and has voiced opposition to the TikTok ban. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the Chinese government was considering a plan to have Musk acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, citing anonymous sources. That followed a report from the Wall Street Journal, which claimed TikTok's CEO had been soliciting advice from Musk ahead of Trump's inauguration. CNBC was unable to reach Musk for comment. \"Elon Musk continues to be front and center as a potential bidder for TikTok which likely includes some tech partners/outside investors to get a deal done,\" financial services company Wedbush Securities said in a research note on Wednesday. \"Musk would be hand picked by Beijing and his ironclad relationship with Trump would make this a very logical choice in our view,\" the note added. Nat Schindler, an analyst at Scotiabank, also noted that Musk's acquisition of Twitter has demonstrated his interest in global social media platforms. However, Paul Triolo of Albright Stone Group also sees some potential obstacles for the tech tycoon. \"Musk is under fire already for owning X and the perception that he is using it to promote certain political ideas, and any involvement in TikTok could draw additional fire and potentially antitrust scrutiny,\" he said. Larry Ellison Trump has also said he'd \"like\" to see Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison purchase the platform . Ellison, a longtime Trump supporter, stood beside the President at a press conference on his AI infrastructure investment plans on Tuesday, where Trump was asked questions about a potential TikTok deal. \"What I'm thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half and we'll give you the permit,\" Trump said before turning to Ellison to ask if the deal sounded reasonable. \"Sounds like a good deal to me Mr. President,\" Ellison replied. Ellison and his company are currently at the center of the TikTok dilemma, operating as a cloud infrastructure provider for ByteDance in the U.S. Given its existing relationship with Tiktok, Oracle and is \"directly invested in Tiktok's success in the region,\" Scotiabank's Schindler said. Ellison had bid for Tiktok, along with Walmart , back in 2020 when Trump first pushed for a ban on the platform. Neither company responded to CNBC's request for comment. Trump had approved of the Walmart-Oracle deal in principle, which would've seen the tech and retail giants partner to take over the video-sharing app in the U.S., avoiding a shutdown. However, the Trump administration's attempt to ban TikTok in the U.S. fell through in the face of legal challenges. Ellison later joined a group of investors that helped Elon Musk buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, in 2022. \"[We believe] Oracle/Ellison could play a pivotal role in any deal given their key technology partnership with TikTok and his appearance at the White House with Project Stargate,\" Wedbush said. Wedbush added that it expects a slew of TikTok bids to come over the coming weeks from a host of players with Musk and Ellison leading the pack. According to a National Public Radio report on Saturday, the Trump administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that would involve Oracle and a group of outside investors ...",

Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on his nomination to be CIA director, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 15, 2025. Jemal Countess | Afp | Getty Images The CIA has shifted its stance about the origin of the virus that causes Covid-19, NBC News reported on Saturday. The intelligence agency now believes that the coronavirus escaped from a Chinese lab, a shift from its previous stance, in which it did not take a position. \"CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting,\" a CIA spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. \"CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible.\" The move comes one day after John Radcliffe, the new director of the CIA, was confirmed. He said on Friday in an interview that he believes U.S. intelligence and science points to the origin of Covid being an accidental release, or \"lab leak,\" from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a research institution in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak was first observed in late 2019. The question of how Covid-19 emerged in humans is fraught. Some, including former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci, believe that the virus crossed over naturally to humans from bats or another intermediate species, potentially at a seafood market in Wuhan in late 2019. Others, including many in the Trump administration and staff for the House Committee for Government Oversight and Reform, believe it escaped from research activities in the region, citing the location of the outbreak, as well as U.S. funding documents describing the work at WIV on similar viruses. China denies a laboratory origin. The New York Times, which first reported the CIA's shift, says that the CIA believes that Chinese leadership doesn't know and doesn't want to know the origin of the virus. The origin has significant implications for international relations with China, public health, and the future of virus research. In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the CIA and 16 other federal intelligence agencies, released a report on the origins of Covid-19 . It said that four IC agencies believe with low confidence that the first infection was caused by natural exposure to an infected animal. It added that one element, identified by the Times as the FBI, believes it was the result of a laboratory incident related to experimentation or animal sampling or handling, with medium confidence. Three agencies at the time said that they were unsure either way. Last year, one of those agencies on the fence, the Energy Department, said that it now favored a laboratory origin with low confidence . The agency believes that the spillover could be related to research activities at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control, a separate institution from WIV, according to the Times . The CIA was also unsure at the time of the initial report, but with Saturday's shift it now favors a laboratory origin. The new assessment, a source told NBC News, isn't based on new information, but rather on a review of existing information. The review started in the closing weeks of the Biden administration and was completed before Trump took office, according to NBC News.

However, the United States isn't the only country with an eye on the region. In 2018, a Chinese state-owned company bid roughly $550 million to expand two airports in Greenland, but the bid was ultimately withdrawn. Meanwhile, Russia has been reopening old Soviet military bases across the Arctic since 2015, including Nagurskoye, located just 600 miles off the northern coast of Greenland. \"Greenland is almost a kind of ground zero for how the Arctic has become more and more geopolitically and strategically significant,\" according to Kalus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London. As China and Russia expand their influence in the Arctic, Greenland's location has become vital to America's ballistic missile warning system. \"With China's rise and its tripling the size of its ICBM ballistic missile arsenal, Greenland plays a national defense role because of its geography,\" said Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Greenland's location also presents a unique economic opportunity, thanks to its proximity to Arctic shipping routes. Shipping over Arctic routes saw a 37% increase between 2013 and 2023, according to the Arctic Council. In 2018, China also announced its intent to construct a \" Polar Silk Road \" linking China and Europe through the Arctic Ocean. \"As the Arctic ice flow has changed in the recent past, and is projected to continue changing, opening up Arctic shipping routes, you have several lucrative potentials there,\" said Sadler.

Drugmakers hope to see efforts that focus more on cracking down on pharmacy benefit managers while promoting drug innovation and patient access to treatments. Those companies are particularly eager to see changes to a provision of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act that allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about prescription drug prices during an appearance in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 20, 2020. Carlos Barria | Reuters Pharmaceutical companies appear to be hopeful about their growth under a Trump administration , after former President Joe Biden took a hardline stance on the industry for the last four years. Like his predecessor, President Donald Trump will make lowering health-care costs for Americans a priority. It's a popular bipartisan issue in a nation where patients pay two-to-three times more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries. Trump has not yet outlined specific health policy plans, but his new administration will likely take a different, more pro-business approach than Biden's did. Drugmakers hope Trump will focus more on cracking down on middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers , while taking heat off the prices the pharma companies themselves charge, promoting drug innovation and improving patient access to treatments. Those companies are particularly eager to see changes to Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which includes landmark provisions that aim to make medicines more affordable — but that the industry views as a threat to innovation and its profits. That was the sentiment during the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco this month, the largest gathering in the U.S. of pharma and biotech executives and investors. The annual conference gives a pulse on the industry's outlook for the year ahead. To no surprise, health policy questions dominated many of the conversations as Trump was heading into office. Trump isn't exactly a friendly face to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, as he targeted companies and high drug costs during his first term through proposals like linking government payments for medicines to lower prices paid abroad. Still, executives stressed they are ready to work with Trump, who some described as being willing to hear out their grievances. \"There are several people that think for our industry, the risks outweigh the opportunities. There are other people, among them myself, which they think that the opportunities outweigh the risks. I guess we'll see,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said during a presentation at the conference. \"What we do as an industry, and as Pfizer, is engage with the new administration,\" he later added. \"We have very productive engagements and we try to explain the positions, I think that are well-understood.\" Still, some executives acknowledged uncertainties around the new administration, such as the anti-vaccine views of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Health experts have said that Kennedy, if confirmed by the Senate , may not do much to stop vaccine approvals, but could deter more Americans from taking recommended shots. \"I think he represents the caution when it comes to the Trump administration,\" BMO biotech analyst Evan Seigerman said. \"You got to figure out how to work with him, right?\" Pharmacy benefit manager reform PBM reform is top of mind for drugmakers. They argue that the middlemen overcharge insurance plans for which they negotiate medication rebates, underpay pharmacies for dispensing prescriptions and fail to pass on savings from those discounts to patients. Congress stripped out bipartisan PBM reforms in the final federal government spending package late last year, even after lawmakers for years introduced bills and held hearings to scrutinize them. But the pharmaceutical industry is \"optimistic\" that it will see PBM reform this year, as Trump, lawmakers and lawmakers from both parties are concerned about their practice s, said Stephen Ubl, CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's biggest lobbying group in the U.S. \"I think there continues to be significant momentum behind PBM reforms, and there will be ... legislative vehicles available this year to move them forward,\" Ubl said in an interview with CNBC. He also pointed to a previous Trump proposal that the president could revisit: To eliminate the so-called safe harbor for rebates – a rule that sought to stop PBMs from keeping rebates an...",

Michiko Tomioka Growing up in Japan , home to some of the world's longest-living people , I fell in love with traditional Japanese food at a young age. My passion for clean and healthy eating is what inspired me to be a nutritionist . My diet has always been centered around nutritious , longevity-fueling and environmentally-friendly foods. Now living in the U.S., I often get my groceries at local markets or organic farms. But when I'm looking to save money and stock up on healthy goods, I send my husband on his favorite errand: a solo trip to Costco. Here are the Costco items I trust and can't live without: 1. Extra firm tofu There's nothing like a hearty bowl of tofu and veggies Michiko Tomioka I've been eating tofu since I was a baby, and it's one thing you'll always find in my fridge . We usually buy two four-pack boxes of organic tofu at Costco, sometimes more. There are so many dishes you can make! And it's really good for you : It's high in protein and provides good fats and a wide variety of vitamins and minerals. Studies have found that tofu can benefit heart health and help reduce the risk of some cancers. DON'T MISS: How to use AI to be more productive and successful at work 2. Frozen edamame Costco grocery haul Michiko Tomioka Edamame is another must-have soy product in our house. At Costco, you can get a bag of 12 individually wrapped 8-ounce portions. This is my most-recommended snack to friends and family. Just microwave a bag for two minutes and enjoy it as a low-calorie, high-protein snack. Edamame is also rich in fiber, antioxidants and vitamin K. 3. Dried goji berries Goji berries have been used as ancient medicine in East Asia for thousands of years. I add them to many dishes, like miso soup, salad, jams and chia pudding. They add natural sweetness and texture. A fourth-cup of goji berries has only 100 calories, 4 grams of protein and fiber, and 800 milligrams of potassium — more than what you get in one banana. 4. Vegetables It's so important to eat your vegetables! Only one out of 10 American adults meet the minimum requirement of vegetable intake , which is five servings daily. I often suggest doubling that number. Regularly eating a variety of veggies makes my body feel clean and energized. Costco has an amazing selection of organic vegetables. We always get the mushroom samplers, English cucumbers and prewashed French beans. They help make weekday meal-prepping easy. 5. Fruits Some of my favorite fruits are oranges, blueberries, bananas and blackberries. I typically buy them organic because I like to eat the skins of some fruits, like kiwi and citruses, for extra fiber and antioxidants. For many fruits, the skin actually has more nutrients than the inside. Avocados are a must-buy at Costco. I like to slice a few into my salad, mixed with lemon juice, walnuts and my signature miso dressing. My husband now uses avocado as a spread on sandwiches instead of butter or cream cheese, and he feels so much healthier! 6. Chicken breast and salmon Salmon and veggies bowl for Genki and Happy Michiko Tomioka I don't eat meat, but my dog Genki and cat Happy need their animal protein. I'm not a fan of ultra-processed pet food, so I like to balance their meals with Costco's organic chicken breast, frozen Atlantic salmon, some edamame, tofu, vegetables, and a variety of legumes. They absolutely love it, and I can't remember the last time they were sick. 7. Unsalted almond butter Almond butter is high in monounsaturated fats, vitamin E, magnesium and other essential minerals that promote heart health . I like to use almond butter instead of oil or butter for baking and cooking. Just make sure you check the ingredients to make sure there's no added salt or sugar. 8. Canned sardines Sardines are one of the most sustainable fishes. For each 3-ounce serving , you get 2 grams of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. This is my husband's go-to \"emergency\" food because it's so fast to prepare. Just sprinkle some turmeric, black pepper and fresh (or powdered) ginger. He eats it with rice, whole wheat bread or noodles. 9. Matcha powder Matcha is a natural medicinal drink that h...",

Dividend-paying stocks can offer investors some cushioning if the market becomes rocky. Amid an uncertain macro backdrop, investors looking for stable returns can add some solid dividend stocks to their portfolios. To select the right dividend stocks, investors can consider insights from top Wall Street analysts, as they analyze a company's ability to pay consistent dividends, backed by solid cash flows. Here are three dividend-paying stocks , highlighted by Wall Street's top pros as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. AT&T This week's first dividend stock is telecommunications company AT&T ( T ). Recently, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.2775 per share, payable on Feb. 3. AT&T stock offers a dividend yield of nearly 5%. Recently, Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner upgraded AT&T stock to buy from hold, with a price target of $27. Bonner's bullish stance follows AT&T's analyst day event, where the company discussed its strategy and long-term financial goals. Bonner noted that management raised its 2024 adjusted EPS outlook and revealed strong estimates for shareholder returns, earnings and cash flow growth, as AT&T \"finishes extricating itself from some troublesome acquisitions and focuses on the convergence of wireless and fiber internet services.\" The analyst expects the company's cost-saving efforts, network modernization, and revenue acceleration to gradually reflect in its performance. He thinks that management's vision of capturing opportunities arising from the convergence of wireless and fiber, along with the company's strategic investments, provides a compelling outlook for future growth and shareholder returns. Bonner noted that at the analyst day event, AT&T indicated that neither dividend hikes nor M&A are under consideration while the company invests in 5G and fiber broadband networks and continues to reduce its debt. That said, management is committed to protecting its dividend payments after reducing them by almost half in March 2022. Bonner highlighted that AT&T plans to return $40 billion to shareholders in 2025-2027 via $20 billion in dividends and $20 billion in share repurchases. Bonner ranks No. 310 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.1%. See AT&T Stock Buybacks on TipRanks. Chord Energy We move to Chord Energy ( CHRD ), an independent oil and gas company operating in the Williston Basin. Under its capital returns program, Chord Energy aims to return more than 75% of its free cash flow. The company recently paid a base dividend of $1.25 per share and a variable dividend of 19 cents per share. Ahead of Chord Energy's Q4 2024 results, Mizuho analyst William Janela reiterated a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $178, calling CHRD a Top Pick. The analyst said that his Q4 2024 estimates for CFPS (cash flow per share) and EBITDX (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and explorations costs) are essentially in line with the Street's estimates. Janela added that compared to its peers, there is more visibility in Chord Energy's outlook for this year, as it has already issued its preliminary guidance. Further, he expects the company to show enhanced capital efficiencies on a year-over-year basis, given that it has fully integrated the assets from the Enerplus acquisition . \"A more defensive balance sheet (~0.2x net debt/EBITDX, one of the lowest among E&P peers) also leaves CHRD well-positioned in a volatile oil price environment,\" said Janela. While CHRD stock underperformed its peers in 2024, the analyst noted that shares are now trading at a wider discount to peers on EV/EBITDX and FCF/EV basis, which he thinks underappreciates the company's improved scale and high-quality inventory in the Bakken basin following the Enerplus acquisition. Finally, based on his Q4 2024 free cash flow (FCF) estimate of $235 million, Janela expects about $176 million of cash return, including $76 million in base dividends. He expects the majority of the variable FCF portion to reflect share buybacks, like in the third quarter. Janela ranks No. 656 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 19.2%. See Chord Energy Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

You might change industries, switch departments or even get laid off. That's why Google Chief Marketing Officer Lorraine Twohill wants young people to \"enjoy the journey\" instead of trying to meticulously plan their entire careers, she told LinkedIn's \"This Is Working\" podcast, in an episode that aired earlier this month. \"Learn as much as you can. I feel like life and companies like Google are more like a jungle gym than a career ladder,\" said Twohill, who manages a team of more than 4,000 employees. \"Try different roles, try different things out for size. Work in different teams, different areas, acquire as many skills as you can. And be informed.\" In her early career, Twohill — who's originally from Ireland — did marketing for European travel companies. She never planned to work for a startup, let alone a tech startup on a different continent. At one of those jobs, she worked with Google, and the company invited her to a meeting. That visit turned into Twohill being questioned during casual chats on beanbag chairs and while in line for barbecue, she said. \"I thought I was going as a VIP client,\" she said. \"But it turned out, 22 interviews later, that I was being interviewed for one of their first roles in Europe.\" DON'T MISS: How to use AI to be more productive and successful at work Twohill became one of the company's first non-U.S. marketing hires in 2003, and moved to the U.S. — another unplanned development, she said — six years later to become Google's head of global marketing. More recently, her career took a different kind of turn: She was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, a rare, aggressive form of cancer in the bile duct, in 2016. She tried to return to a workaholic pace after treatment, but found it was unsustainable, she said. Now, she no longer works late into the night, doesn't try to respond to all her emails and has found \"peace\" in not trying to be perfect all the time, said Twohill. To her surprise, her career didn't fall apart, and she's been happier and healthier since, she added. Her advice echoes comments from bestselling author and millionaire entrepreneur Seth Godin, who says following a predetermined path won't lead you to success and happiness in your career. Godin's accomplishments feel fulfilling specifically because he's never followed a career plan, he told LinkedIn's \" The Path \" newsletter in 2023. His advice: Use \"a compass and not a map.\" Your compass is your big-picture goal, who you aspire to be outside of a job title. Following it means pursuing decisions that make you happier and more content in the short-term, rather than following a pre-planned set of steps that might eventually lead to a \"dream job\" if you're incredibly lucky, Godin said. Your short-term decisions won't always pan out, but you'll learn enough from each failure to eventually succeed, Godin said. And you'll have \"more fun\" along the way, he noted.

Adults with social anxiety and depression tend to work fewer hours, according to the recent study published in Psychiatric Research & Clinical Practice. Researchers analyzed the data of 250 adults between ages 18 and 60 who were diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. During a 52-week period, they tracked how many hours each participant worked and recorded their anxiety and depression symptoms to see if their mental state could predict hours worked. CEOs and employees both are negatively effected when poor mental health persists, says Natalie Datillo, a clinical psychologist and instructor at Harvard Medical School. Depression and anxiety are treated differently, but they both cause people to isolate, she says. \"What comes with avoidance is isolation and withdrawal and limiting our opportunity to have positively reinforcing experiences,\" she says. Working can provide some safeguards that are often overlooked. \"Work has a protective effect on our mental health,\" she says. \"Overall working is good for us from a mental health standpoint. It provides structure for our life, it gives us something to do, it allows us an opportunity to interact with other people, not to mention it allows us to have an income.\" 'The less we do, the less likely we are to experience things that make us feel better' A person who struggles with some anxious tendencies might find it challenging to go to work, give presentations, and interact with co-workers, but ultimately isn't plagued by their decision to do so. \"For the most part we can pull it together and do it and feel better afterwards,\" Datillo says. \"With folks who struggle with an anxiety disorder they don't feel better. They spend the rest of the day overthinking or ruminating or obsessing on how they did, what are other people thinking.\" If they are depressed, harsh self-criticism can kick-in, as well. This can cause them to leave early, call in sick, and self-isolate even more. Ironically, the more they avoid work the more severe their anxiety and depression symptoms can become, Datillo says. \"The less we do and the more we avoid, the less likely we are to experience things that make us feel better,\" she says. By caring about their employees' mental health, companies might actually be helping their bottom line. Want to up your AI skills and be more productive?

BYD has not announced plans to sell the Shark in the U.S., but it has entered countries where GM, Ford and Toyota have sold pickup trucks globally, including Australia, Brazil and Mexico. There's fear among global automakers that Chinese rivals could flood their markets, undercutting domestic production and vehicle prices to the detriment of their own auto industries. BYD Shark plug-in hybrid electric pickup truck Michael Wayland / CNBC DETROIT — There's a Shark circling one of the greatest profit pools for American automakers globally, as Chinese automaker BYD Auto expands its reach and product portfolio with a pickup truck. Without the vehicle's branding badge, the BYD Shark could pass as an American-made product. In many ways, it looks like a smaller pickup from Ford Motor. The China-made truck features uncanny exterior resemblances to a Ford Explorer mixed with the popular F-150 — part of the Ford brand's best-selling truck lineup in the U.S. for 48 years. Much like BYD's Seagull — a small all-electric hatchback that starts at just 69,800 yuan (or less than $10,000) — there's fear among global automakers that Chinese rivals like the Warren Buffett -backed BYD could flood their markets, undercutting domestic production and vehicle prices to the detriment of their own auto industries. BYD has not announced plans to sell the Shark in the U.S., but it has entered countries where General Motors , Ford and Toyota Motor sell pickup trucks, including Australia, Brazil and Mexico. In the U.S., pickup trucks are the bread-and-butter vehicles for the Detroit automakers, combining for millions of units of sales annually. They've also become increasingly important for Toyota in the U.S. and globally. BYD Shark plug-in hybrid electric pickup truck Michael Wayland / CNBC \"When you consider the importance, from a revenue perspective, that these products bring to manufacturers, it's the franchise,\" said Terry Woychowski, president of automotive at Caresoft Global who formerly was a chief engineer of GM's full-size trucks. \"There's been a lot of interest in this vehicle because of the market.\" Caresoft, an engineering benchmarking and consulting firm, has torn down and examined roughly 40 China-built EVs from the likes of BYD, Nio and others. The Michigan-based company digitally and physically analyzes every part of a vehicle, from bolts and latches to seats, motors and battery casings. It then determines how its clients — mainly automakers and suppliers — can improve efficiencies and cut costs in their products. Drawing attention Automakers such as Ford and Toyota that rely heavily on sales of smaller pickup trucks globally have taken notice of the BYD Shark. \"It's a great product. It's sold well. They're trying to sell in high volume in Mexico, but it's also being localized in Thailand,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said when asked by CNBC earlier this month about the BYD Shark. \"If we want to be a global player in pickups, like we are now, we have to compete.\" 2024 Ford Ranger XLT Sport Ford While Ford's F-150 reigns supreme in the U.S., Toyota's Hilux has been the top-selling truck outside of North America for many years. Toyota has sold 19.8 million Hilux trucks since its introduction in 1968, including a record of 851,000 units in 2022. When asked about Chinese competitors earlier this month, Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda said the company \"needs to be prepared to respond to the global needs of the global markets,\" regardless of the competition. \"We try to focus on the needs of each individual market and try to be best in town. So that will be the strategy that we have,\" Toyoda said during a media roundtable at the CES tech conference. BYD reportedly exported more than more than 10,000 BYD Sharks in 2024. Such sales are expected to increase going forward, especially as the company prepares to expand production. BYD has grown its share of vehicle exports from China from 2%, or less than 56,000 units, in 2022 to 8% in 2024, or 350,500 units, according to BofA Securities. Exporting has continued to assist BYD in increasing its sales globally to approximately 4.3 million vehicles in 2024, up from roughly 3 million a year earlier. Wall Street analysts expect that to continue to grow this year to roughly 5.5 million this year, according to Goldman Sachs.

It was supposed to be the off-season. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, has more than 60 fixed-wing and rotor-wing firefighting aircraft, which it calls the largest civil fleet of its kind. But the federal government, U.S. states and countries from Australia to Chile to South Korea hire companies that have their own private fleets of specially outfitted aircraft to help tame fires. \"I was lucky to have two\" aircraft available to help fight the flames, said Joel Kerley, CEO of 10 Tanker Air Carrier, based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The company has a fleet of four converted DC-10 aircraft, known as very large air tankers, or VLATs. A plane makes a drop as smoke billows from the Palisades Fire at the Mandeville Canyon, in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 11, 2025. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters The wildfire season in the U.S. normally runs from April to about November, when 10 Tanker and similar companies are under round-the-clock contracts with the U.S. Forest Service, a federal agency. In 2023, the U.S. Forest Service extended a 10-year contract worth as much as $7.2 billion to 10 Tanker and four other providers. Outside of those months, providers are generally on a call-when-needed basis. And demand for their services continues to rise, year-round, these firms say. Wildfires are expected to become even more prevalent and severe in the 21st century, according to the United Nations Environment Program. The United States Environmental Protection Agency said data appears to show that the area destroyed by wildfires in the U.S. has gone up over the last two decades. \"There's not enough air tankers to go around,\" said Kerley, the former aviation manager for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, part of the Department of the Interior. Flowers and a car are covered by fire retardant as the Palisades Fire, one of simultaneous blazes that have ripped across Los Angeles County, burns at the Mandeville Canyon, a neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, U.S. Jan. 11, 2025. Ringo Chiu | Reuters Some countries that have faced severe wildfires in recent years, like Australia, have been building up their own fleets of firefighting aircraft. Kerley said they will need to expand their fleets or companies like his will have to get bigger to meet growing demand. Kerley said the Palisades and Eaton fires were some of the most complicated to fight. Fed by hurricane-force winds, they leveled entire neighborhoods like Altadena and were some of the worst ever in California. They were also a reminder to firefighters, government officials and the public that fires could spring up when they're least expected. Those two fires have consumed more than 37,000 acres and damaged or destroyed over 16,000 homes, buildings and other structures, making them two of the most destructive wildfires ever in California. At least 28 people were killed, according to Cal Fire. Kerley said days into the new year he was asking his crews of pilots and mechanics to travel to blazes he equated to \"the Super Bowl\" of fire response. 10 Tanker's planes have dropped more than 273,000 gallons of fire retardant on the Eaton and Palisades fires. Both of those fires were largely contained as of Friday, but companies like Kerley's were still on call as the Hughes fire was spreading rapidly north of Los Angeles, prompting a new round of evacuations. An air tanker drops fire retardant at the Palisades Fire, one of simultaneous blazes that have ripped across Los Angeles County, as seen from Woodland Hills, neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, U.S. Jan. 11, 2025. Ringo Chiu | Reuters Since the devastating Los Angeles blazes struck during what is supposed to be the region's off-season for wildfires, some of 10 Tanker's aircraft were stuck in routine maintenance earlier on in the battle. And he wasn't alone. \"We're in heavy winter maintenance on all of our aircraft,\" said Sam Davis, CEO of Belgrade, Montana-based Bridger Aerospace, which has a fleet of Canada-made Super Scoopers that scoop up water as they're flying along the water and dump the water near fires. They can make several trips on one flight. \"It was a push to get the first aircraft out the door,\" Davis said. In November, Bridger reported record revenue and profits for its third quarter, saying \"continued dry weather in the western U.S. kept multiple aircraft operating into November.\" It increased its revenue...",

However, the Trump family's various meme coins elicited skepticism and sparked concern among industry executives and investors. FRANCE - 2025/01/20: In this photo illustration, Trump Meme , Trump the Crypto president, is seen displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Romain Doucelin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Romain Doucelin | Getty Images Crypto executives, companies and investors are getting an early return on their investment in Donald Trump. After pouring tens of millions of dollars into Trump's 2024 campaign for president, the crypto industry has been paid back handsomely during his first week in the White House. \"I don't think they could have imagined a better outcome than they just got in the past 48 hours,\" Benchmark's Bill Gurley, known for an early bet on Uber , told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Friday. Gurley said that while tech's newfound influence in Washington may be harmful to some parts of the startup world, \"it's obviously good for crypto.\" The industry's support for Trump was built on the Republican leader's promise to stop the government's crackdown on crypto and implement regulations favorable to those who wanted to develop new types of payment technologies while easing restrictions on investments in cryptocurrencies. Industry heavyweights like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Binance CEO Richard Teng are lauding the start of a new era. \"You have to remember, the last four years, we really felt like we were being attacked by this administration,\" Armstrong told CNBC at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Armstrong criticized the Biden White House for trying to \"weaponize the lack of clarity in the rules,\" punishing even the companies that were trying to be helpful. \"There were some bad actors too, to be fair,\" Armstrong said. \"But they even really tried to go after the good actors, I think, like us.\" Coinbase was one of the leading corporate donors in the 2024 election cycle. Bitcoin hit a record high of around $109,000 on Monday and hovered near $105,000 by the end of the week. It's up more than 50% since Trump's election victory in early November. Trump's crypto executive order U.S. President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order on cryptocurrencies in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on Jan. 23, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters The 48-hour stretch referenced by Gurley included an executive order signed by Trump on Thursday to promote digital asset adoption in the U.S. Trump called on members of Treasury, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to join forces in a working group to evaluate the potential of stockpiling cryptocurrencies seized by the government. The order outlined other key priorities, such as protecting bitcoin miners and software developers from what the president called \"persecution,\" and promoting U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, while banning a digital dollar from the Federal Reserve. Venture capitalist David Sacks, who Trump tapped to be the White House AI and crypto czar, joined the president in the Oval Office for the signing of the order. Later on Thursday, the SEC made a landmark announcement, withdrawing an accounting rule that made institutional crypto adoption more difficult by forcing banks to treat bitcoin and other tokens as a liability on their balance sheet. The rule, known as SAB 121, was introduced in 2022 and subjected digital assets to strict capital requirements. It also raised the financial and regulatory risks of offering crypto custody services and boosted operational costs for financial institutions. Efforts to overturn SAB 121 gained bipartisan support in Congress last year. But then-President Biden vetoed the proposed legislation, leaving the rule intact, further discouraging banks from adopting digital assets beyond derivatives trading and offering exchange-traded funds to wealth management clients. The move was celebrated by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who on Tuesday was tapped to lead a new \"crypto task force\" within the agency. \"Bye, bye SAB 121! It's not been fun,\" she wrote in a post on X . Before the SEC's announcement, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told CNBC in Davos that from a regulatory perspective, the bank couldn't own bitcoin and that it would revisit the issue if the rules changed. The CEOs of Morgan Stanley and Bank of America also said that President Trump's pro-crypto tone could reshape their plans and potentially lead to expanded digital offerings. Days earlier, Gary Gensler stepped down from his role...",

In this article GOOGL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty Images Alphabet shares closed at $200 per share for the first time on Friday as investors grow increasingly bullish on the company's opportunities in artificial intelligence. The stock gained 1.1% on Friday and a little more than 2% for the week to close at $200.21. It is up almost 6% in 2025, while the Nasdaq is up 3.3% so far this year. Alphabet's fresh record is on a split-adjusted basis. The company implemented a 20-for-1 stock split in 2022. At the time of that announcement, the stock was trading at about $2,750, equivalent to $137.50 after the split. Tech's megacap companies start reporting earnings next week, with Microsoft , Meta and Tesla scheduled to announce results on Wednesday, followed by Apple on Thursday. Alphabet is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 4. Alphabet's revenue in the third quarter increased 15% from a year earlier, accelerating from about 11% growth during the same period in 2024. The company generated $88.3 billion in sales in the third quarter and saw record cloud revenue. While Alphabet faces increased competition due to advancements in generative AI, particularly from OpenAI, analysts generally view Google as a winner in AI as the company adds new features to products across its portfolio. In a report on Friday, Morgan Stanley analysts pointed to the company's progress of its AI agent products, Project Astra and Project Mariner, as well as its large language model Gemini 2.0 released in 2024. Still, the firm said \"the utility bar to hurdle and scale\" its consumer products is \"high.\" In a 2025 strategy meeting with employees last month, Google executives said they expect a year of increased competition, regulatory hurdles and advancements in AI.  Despite product mishaps in the first half of 2024, the second half of the year featured numerous important AI products. Alphabet shares have gained 35% over the past year. Among tech's highest-valued companies, the best performer has been Nvidia, up 132%, followed by Tesla at 96%.

From her debut in 1994's \"The Mask\" until her final appearance in 2014's \"Annie,\" Diaz appeared in at least one film per year. But despite the success of her multi-decade run, the 52-year-old said recently that the best years of her life came after she left movies behind. In an appearance on The Graham Norton Show while promoting her return to the big screen following a decade-long \"retirement,\" the \"Charlie's Angels\" star said that stepping away from her showbiz career was the best decision she ever could have made. \"I loved it. It was the best 10 years of my life,\" Diaz said. \"I was just free to kind of be [like] 'I'm a mom, I'm a wife, I'm living my life.'\" She said when she first began her retirement she would still receive offers to for roles. But after constantly turning them down, \"people stopped asking.\" \"It was so lovely,\" she said. Diaz spent her time off from acting raising children, writing a book and launching a wine company. Diaz, who received a reported $45 million from Netflix to star in two films, said that after 10 years the return to acting \"made sense\" for her family. On top of that, the \"Shrek\" actor said she wanted to embrace the privilege of getting to star in movies. \"I just thought to myself ... if I don't engage that again and give that a chance and participate it and be grateful for it, I would be a fool,\" she said.

Photo: Vanessa Wachtmeister At the age of 33, I sometimes feel like I've already lived a thousand lives. I'm originally from Los Angeles, and over the last decade, I've done everything from teaching English in China to serving as an emergency aid worker in Turkey during the war in Syria. After I completed my master's degree in London, I started working as a product manager for a global travel tech company, and I had the option to transfer to the U.S. or to Germany, where my husband is from. When considering my decision, I did some math and I realized that in Germany, even on a lower salary than what I would be potentially earning in the U.S., I could achieve my financial goals, like paying off my student debt , faster. Since February 2020, I have called Berlin, Germany home, and I have never been happier. Here is why I love living here: DON'T MISS: How to use AI to be more productive and successful at work I adore our quiet, cozy neighborhood My husband and I live in an area west of Berlin called Charlottenburg, a relatively quiet neighborhood filled with cozy coffee shops and middle-class families. I am on a first-name basis with many of the shop owners, and I love the community here. We live in a 1,100-square-foot, 2-bedroom apartment with a balcony. We pay $1,843 per month for rent, about $350 for utilities, and $240 for parking. We were paying about the same in London, but our Berlin apartment is double the size, and the building is much newer. Taking in the sunshine and a beautiful day in the city. Photo: Vanessa Wachtmeister For groceries, I'm a big fan of METRO, which is essentially the Costco of Germany. Every two weeks, we spend about $300 on our bulk staples. We fill in as necessary with other items bought from local budget retailers like Aldi and Lidl. Lidl sells 45 cent Brötchen, or bread rolls, that are my favorite. Moving here helped me pay off debt In Germany, the government provides things like guaranteed healthcare, pensions, parental leave, tuition-free university and even unemployment insurance. I have a few friends who were laid off, but thanks to that insurance, they were able to receive 80% of their salary for one year. When I was deciding between the U.S. and Germany, I crunched some numbers and realized that with the social safety net — and not having to set aside thousands of dollars for medical emergencies, for example — I would be able to save between $1,000 and $3,000 each month. That's made a huge difference. In front of Brandenburg Gate. Photo: Vanessa Wachtmeister When I arrived, I was facing down $130,000 in student debt. I was able to pay off all of it in November 2023, all while still saving and investing for my future. It has been a huge weight off my shoulders, and I don't worry about not being able to pay my bills here. My money goes farther, and I'm also happy to contribute my fair share so people can access support when they need it. There is a palpable sense of community What surprised and delighted me the most when I arrived in Berlin was the deep sense of egalitarianism that everyone seemed to share, no matter their background. Many cultural events have free entry, because access and participation are big core values here. One of my favorite things to do during the summer is explore cafes in other neighborhoods and go to food festivals. Enjoying a beverage and the ambiance at an outdoor cafe. Photo: Vanessa Wachtmeister The festivals are fun, inexpensive (I'm usually spending just $12 on a drink and snacks) and often celebrate different cultures and countries. It's a great way to meet like-minded people in a city of 6 million. I've also found that Berlin's immigrant community, which I'm so proud to be a member of, is especially friendly. We all understand how isolating the experience of finding your footing in a new place can be. I have access to the rest of the European Union In February, I will have been a German resident for five years. That means I'll be eligible to apply for a passport and dual citizenship, instead of just permanent residency. Here I am in Potsdamer Platz, next to one of the pieces of the Berlin Wall on display there. Photo: V...",

Here are the steps the activist may take to improve margins Published Sat, Jan 25 2025 6:48 AM EST Kenneth Squire @13DMonitor WATCH LIVE In this article QRVO Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Qorvo logo of a US semiconductor company is seen displayed on a smartphone and pc screen. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images Company: Qorvo Inc (QRVO) Business: Qorvo is a global supplier of semiconductor solutions. The company operates through three segments: High Performance Analog (HPA), Connectivity and Sensors Group (CSG) and Advanced Cellular Group (ACG). The HPA segment is a global supplier of radio frequency (RF), analog mixed signal and power management solutions. The CSG segment is a global supplier of connectivity and sensor solutions. The ACG segment is a global supplier of cellular RF solutions for smartphones, wearables, laptops, tablets and other devices. Stock Market Value : ~$8.41B ($88.94 per share) Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Qorvo shares over the past 12 months Activist: Starboard Value Ownership: 7.71% Average Cost: $70.92 Activist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 13 prior semiconductor companies, and the firm's average return on these situations is 85.87% versus an average of 28.91% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. What's happening Starboard acquired a 7.71% position for investment purposes. Behind the scenes Qorvo is a global semiconductor company that specializes in manufacturing radio frequency (RF) chips for applications across mobile devices, wireless infrastructure, aerospace and defense, and other end markets. The company is organized into three operating and reportable segments: (i) High Performance Analog (HPA) supplying RF, analog mixed signal and power management solutions; (ii) Connectivity and Sensors Group (CSG) supplying connectivity and sensor solutions; and (iii) Advanced Cellular Group (ACG) supplying cellular RF solutions for smartphones and other devices. In 2024, Qorvo generated $3.77 billion of revenue, of which approximately 75% was attributable to ACG. While the company is diversified across multiple industries, it is particularly reliant on RF sales for mobile devices, with 46% and 12% of total revenue attributable to just Apple and Samsung, respectively, in FY24. Qorvo was formed as a result of a merger of equals in an all-stock transaction between RF Micro Devices (RFMD) and TriQuint Semiconductor (TQNT) that was announced in February 2014 and completed in January 2015 . Starboard is quite familiar with Qorvo considering that the firm was a 13D filer on TriQuint in 2013.  On Oct. 29, 2013, Starboard sent a letter to TriQuint outlining the company's undervaluation, underperformance, and put forward value-enhancing proposals. On Dec. 2, 2013, Starboard nominated a majority slate of six director candidates to the board for the 2014 annual meeting. However, the engagement never went to a proxy fight, as Starboard issued a letter supporting TriQuint's proposed merger with RFMD in March 2014 and exited its 13D. In under a year of engagement, Starboard made a 113.15% return on their investment versus 23.80% for the Russell 2000. The merger was pitched to shareholders as an opportunity to create new growth opportunities in mobile devices, network infrastructure, and aerospace and defense, bolstered by the new company's scale advantages, product portfolio, improved operating model and $150 million in cost synergies. The announcement was met with tremendous excitement, as shares of TriQuint and RFMD rocketed approximately 200% from the day prior to the announcement up to their combination.  However, one-year post-transaction the newly-formed Qorvo was down 27.7%. For functionally a decade, from merger completion to the day prior to Starboard Value disclosing its 7.71% stake, the stock traded flat, up just a mere 4.5%. This is quite staggering underperformance when semiconductors have been the beneficiaries of tremendous secular tailwinds in recent years. Over the same time period, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index is up over 650%. The opportunity to improve value at Qorvo is simple, operationally focused and something Starboard has done many times at many semiconductor companies: margin improvement. Despite Qorvo's excellent product portfolio and competitiveness with peers Broadcom and Skyworks Solutions , the company's gross and operating margins have been inferior. Last fiscal year, Qorvo had a gross margin of 39.5% and an operating margin of 8.3%, whereas its peer Skyworks boasted margins of 44.2% and 24.9% respectively. Despite having roughly similar levels of revenue ($4.7 billion for Skyworks and $3.8 billion for Qorvo), Qorvo spends 10.3% of revenue on selling, general and administrative e...",

Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday announced the company plans to invest around $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as it continues to build out its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Zuckerberg said 2025 will be \"a defining year for AI\" and that Meta is building a large datacenter that \"would cover a significant part of Manhattan\" to power its AI offerings. Additionally, Meta will bring on around 1 gigawatt in compute and end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, he said. \"This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Facebook. Meta shares closed at $647.49 on Friday, a new all-time high after the announcement. The company has been pouring billions of dollars into AI and ramping up related research and development in recent years, but it's a fiercely competitive market and will take time before investors begin to reap those benefits. In an April call with investors, Zuckerberg said he expects to see a \" multiyear investment cycle \" before Meta's AI products will scale into profitable services, but he also noted that the company has a \"strong track record\" in that department. Shares of Meta plunged 16% at the time. The company still generates the vast majority of its revenue from digital advertising. Zuckerberg said Friday that he expects the company's Meta AI digital assistant to become the \"leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people.\" Meta is also building an AI engineer that will contribute \"increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts,\" Zuckerberg added. \"We have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead,\" he wrote in his Facebook post.

Shares ended the day at $24, putting the company's market capitalization around $58 billion. Venture is the second-largest LNG exporter in the U.S. behind Cheniere . The company had priced its initial public offering of 70 million shares at $25 to raise $1.75 billion for a total valuation of about $60.5 billion. But the stock opened 3.8% below that price at $24.05 when trading began on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon. Even before that opening trade, Venture had already steeply slashed its IPO price from its original target. The company had originally planned to offer 50 million shares in a range of $40 to $46, which would have raised about $2.2 billion at the midpoint for a total valuation of $110 billion. Still, Venture's IPO is the largest by an oil and gas company in a decade and the fourth-largest since 2000. At a valuation of around $60 billion, it would be the tenth-largest publicly traded energy company. Venture is in various stages of commissioning, building and developing five natural gas liquefaction and export facilities near the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana. Those projects are expected to have peak production capacity of 143.8 million tonnes per year, according to the company's prospectus. However, Venture is locked in arbitration with customers, including majors such as Shell , who are accusing the company of failing to deliver LNG cargoes under long-term contract from its Calcasieu Pass plant in Louisiana. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Monday declared a national energy emergency and issued an executive order overturning the Biden administration's pause on new LNG export projects, removing a potential obstacle to Venture's growth. Trump's policies, combined with cold winter weather and expected robust demand from artificial intelligence, is helping to drive both natural gas prices and related stocks higher. Cheniere shares, for example, have climbed more than 20% since Trump was elected. Natural gas prices rose 44% over that same time.

The trial showed average weight reduction of 22% in obese and overweight patients after 36 weeks. The study was conducted on 125 overweight or obese patients and the most common side effects were gastrointestinal. A view of the logo of Novo Nordisk at the company's office in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark, March 8, 2024. Tom Little | Reuters Shares of Novo Nordisk jumped Friday after the Danish pharmaceutical giant reported positive early-stage results for its once weekly amycretin obesity drug. The trial showed that the treatment, which is administered via injection, resulted in average weight reduction of 22% in obese and overweight patients after 36 weeks. That compares with weight gain of 2.0% among patients treated with a placebo over the same period of time. Shares closed 7.13% higher, paring earlier gains of nearly 14% but still recording the best single session since March 2024. Shares of fellow Danish obesity drug maker Zealand Pharma also tracked higher, last up 4.7%, while Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly dipped in premarket trade. Amycretin targets the same gut hormone that Wegovy mimics, known as GLP-1, as well as a pancreas hormone called amylin that affects hunger. Wegovy is Novo Nordisk's flagship obesity drug while Ozempic is its diabetes treatment. The trial was conducted on 125 overweight or obese patients and the most common side effects were gastrointestinal, with the vast majority being \"mild to moderate in severity.\" \"We are very encouraged by the subcutaneous phase 1b/2a results for amycretin in people living with overweight or obesity,\" Martin Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement. \"The results seen in the trial support the weight lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, that we have previously seen with the oral formulation.\" Novo is also developing an amycretin obesity pill. Early-stage trials announced in September, showed average weight loss of 13.1% after 12 weeks.

Speaking at a fringe event in Davos, Finance Minister Rachel Reeves said the government would put forward an amendment after \"listening to the concerns\" of the non-dom community. The changes come as new data estimates 10,800 millionaires left the U.K. last year amid a clampdown on the uber wealthy in the October budget. Rachel Reeves, UK Finance Minister, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 22, 2025. Gerry Miller | CNBC The U.K. will soften some planned changes to its controversial non-dom tax rule following concerns of a millionaire exodus, the Treasury has confirmed. Britain's 200-year-old non-dom regime permits people living in the U.K., but who are domiciled elsewhere for tax purposes, to avoid paying levies on income and capital gains earnings overseas for up to 15 years. The regime has long courted controversy, leading U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves in her October budget to confirm that it would be abolished from April 2025, and that all long-term residents would be subject to inheritance tax (IHT) on their worldwide assets, including those held in trust. Speaking at a fringe event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Reeves said the government would soon put forward an amendment to the country's Finance Bill, increasing the generosity of a rule which allows non-doms to bring money to the UK without paying significant taxes. \"We have been listening to the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community,\" Reeves told The Wall Street Journal's Emma Tucker when asked about recent departures of the ultra-wealthy. \"In the finance bill, we will be tabling an amendment which makes more generous the temporary repatriation facility, which enables non-doms to bring money into the UK without paying significant taxes,\" she added. Reeves on Thursday also sought to reassure wealthy overseas investors that the changes would not affect double-taxation agreements held between the U.K. and other countries. \"There's been some concerns from countries that have double taxation conventions with the U.K., including India, that they would be drawn in to be paying inheritance tax. That's not the case. We're not going to be changing those double taxation conventions,\" she said. In a statement to CNBC confirming the plans, a Treasury spokesperson said the tweaks were designed to motivate non-doms \"to bring their funds to the U.K., encouraging them to spend and invest this money here.\" \"While we do not expect these changes to impact the £33.8 billion of tax revenue that the OBR forecast to raise over five years, they reflect our continued engagement with stakeholders to make sure the reforms announced at Budget operate as intended,\" the statement added. watch now VIDEO 4:25 04:25 UK faces ultra-wealthy exodus amid non-dom tax changes Street Signs Europe The government's October clampdown on non-doms formed part of wider measures aimed at the upper echelons, with new levies placed on private equity bosses, private schools, second homes and private jets. Critics warned at the time that the moves would spark a mass exit of ultra wealthy individuals — many of whom, they said, would be key contributors to the government's pro-investment agenda. An estimated 10,800 millionaires left the U.K. last year, according to updated figures from global analytics firm New World Wealth and investment migration advisers Henley & Partners, a 157% increase on 2023. \"Most eligible HNW taxpayers will wish to make full use of the temporary repatriation facility (TRF) and will welcome the news that the scheme is to be made more attractive,\" James Austen, tax partner at Collyer Bristow, said that the amendment signaled on Thursday would be welcome news for many high net worth taxpayers, but he questioned whether it would be enough to stem wealth outflows. \"The government's proposed amendment to the Finance Bill is not a significant change to its plans, and many of the concerns about the new regime, particular in relation to trusts and IHT, remain. I don't expect this will 'move the dial' for most non-doms,\" he said by email. \"The TRF is welcome news to the non-dom community still in the UK who may now stay a while longer, although this may only delay but not prevent their plans to leave, and for others it may be too little too late,\" added Matthew Braitwaite, head of Wedlake Bell's private client offshore team.",

Here’s what to know before planning a trip Spain attracted a record/whopping 94 million tourists last year, making the Southern European nation famous for its Mediterranean coastline and historic sites one of the most visited countries on earth By The Associated Press January 27, 2025, 8:18 AM 1:06 FILE - Worshippers attend a Mass in the Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona, Spain, July 9, 2023. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti, file) The Associated Press MADRID -- Spain attracted a record 94 million tourists last year , making the Southern European nation famous for its Mediterranean coastline, sweeping landscapes and historic cities among the most visited countries on earth. The surge in visitors has stoked complaints at times from some Spaniards about “overtourism, ” with concerns about overcrowding , water use and particularly the availability and affordability of housing. Spain's government has started listening to demands for more regulation, particularly around housing in Spain's big cities, where rising home and rental prices have become a key concern for voters. Earlier this month, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez introduced a 12-part plan to tackle the housing crisis, with measures aimed at bringing stricter regulations to short-term rentals that mainly cater to tourists. But that doesn't mean Spain is putting the brakes on tourism, an industry that accounts for about 12% of its GDP. Here's what you should know before planning a visit: No, but some cities have started to regulate tourism rental properties. Malaga, an Andalusian port city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain, will prohibit new rental properties in 43 neighborhoods of the city where those rentals exceed 8% of the residential stock. The policy went into effect earlier this month and will be tested for three years. Meanwhile, Barcelona plans to close down all of its 10,000 apartments licensed as short-term rentals in the coming years to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents. The Mediterranean city known for its beaches, art and surrealist architecture announced last year that it would not renew any new tourism apartment licenses after they expire in 2028. Yes. Tourists can book hotel stays and short-term apartment-style rentals just about anywhere in Spain. Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas. Short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists are seen as driving up rental costs for locals, too. Visitors renting a car in Spain or booking hotel stays will also have to file more paperwork thanks to a new law that requires hotel owners and car rental companies to send personal information to the government for national security reasons. Passport details, home addresses and payment information used by travelers above 14 are among the details that will be collected. Related Topics Spain Travel",

The German rescue ship Sea Punk I recovered the body of a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old died on board the vessel while medical personnel attempted life-saving measures, said the group's spokesman Gerson Reschke. Survivors reported that several more people had drowned during the voyage, including another small child. Sea Punks said that people were drifting in the water on both sides of the boat when the rescue vessel arrived in response to an emergency call. “All available rescue equipment was used to save as many people as possible,’’ it said in statement. The rescue happened in a part of the Malta search-and-rescue zone that is closer to Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa than the tiny EU island nation. A Malta rescue helicopter evacuated a pregnant woman and a severely injured man. Sea Punks 1 transferred 15 survivors and the two bodies to an Italian coast guard vessel, which brought them to Lampedusa. Many showed signs of severe hypothermia, the group said. The U.N. Missing Migrant Project puts the number of the dead and missing in the perilous Central Mediterranean at over 24,506 from 2014-2024, many of whom were lost at sea. The project says that number may be greater, as many deaths go unrecorded, with the sightings of so-called ghost ships with noone aboard and remains of people washing ashore in Libya not associated with any known shipwreck. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told top Indian foreign affairs official Vikram Misri that the sides “should seize the opportunity, meet each other halfway, explore more substantive measures, and strive to understand, support and achieve each other, rather than be suspicious of, alienate and consume each other,” China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited Miri as saying the nuclear-armed Asian giants have “properly managed and resolved differences, and promoted the restart of practical cooperation in various fields.” Ties have been stable since the leaders of the two countries met last year on the sidelines of a multinational summit in Russia. Days before that meeting, India announced the two sides had agreed to a pact on military patrols along their disputed border in the Himalayas after a spike in tensions that began with a deadly clash in 2020. That turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets. Chinese President Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi have since limited their joint public comments to pleasantries without openly discussing the border. India said the 2024 agreement would lead to the “disengagement” of troops at the Line of Actual Control , the long shared border in the Himalayas, although it's unclear whether that meant the withdrawal of the tens of thousands of additional troops stationed along their disputed border in the Ladakh region. The Line of Actual Control separates Chinese and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India’s eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. India and China fought a deadly war over the border in 1962. Both India and China have withdrawn troops from face-off sites on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso, Gogra and Galwan Valley, but they maintain extra troops at Demchok and Depsang Plains. The army standoff damaged business ties between the two nations with halted investments from Chinese firms and major projects banned. India also banned Chinese-owned apps , including TikTok, which is operated by Chinese internet firm Bytedance. It cited privacy concerns that it said threatened India’s sovereignty and security. Chinese products are ubiquitous in India, from toys to smartphones to made-in-China Hindu idols. According to Indian government data, two-way trade has grown by the tens of billions in the past two decades, with the balance strongly favoring China, while China has drawn many Indian specialists and students, particularly in the medical field.

(The Royal Thai Police via AP) The Associated Press BEIJING -- Chinese authorities have detained a key suspect in human trafficking cases linked to online scam networks near the borders of Myanmar and Thailand, China’s Ministry of Public Security said, weeks after the high-profile disappearance of an actor sparked safety concerns. The suspect, surnamed Yan, was captured through the joint efforts of the ministry, the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and Thai law enforcement officers, it said. Yan had returned to China on Saturday and an investigation is ongoing, it said in a statement late Sunday. It vowed to deepen law enforcement cooperation with other countries and spare no effort in arresting suspects in the scam networks. Earlier this month, Chinese actor Wang Xing was lured by a promise of an acting opportunity and traveled to Thailand but instead was taken across the border into Myanmar, where police believe he was put to work in a call scam operation targeting Chinese people, Thai police said. Wang was eventually sent back to China, but his case has sparked fears about travel to Thailand among many Chinese, clouding the Southeast Asian country's tourism prospects during the Lunar New Year holidays, which begin Tuesday. Last week, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra used a video generated by artificial intelligence to assure Chinese tourists that her government is boosting security and attaches great importance to the safety of tourists. But a series of recent human trafficking cases has already harmed Thai tourism. A concert by Hong Kong pop star Eason Chan in Bangkok in February was canceled due to safety concerns for Chinese citizens. Users on China's Weibo social media platform also expressed fears about visiting Thailand. Criminal activity has flourished in border areas of military-ruled Myanmar, where fighting has pitted armed ethnic groups against the army for decades. Chinese authorities say they have cracked down on criminal syndicates in joint operations with neighboring countries, leading to thousands of people being returned to China, but those campaigns did not include arrests of ring leaders in Myanmar. People from Malaysia and the Philippines lured by job offerings in Myanmar have also been forced to work in call centers against their will. Chinese investors operate casino complexes in Myanmar in what amounts to autonomous development zones in cooperation with Myanmar’s Border Guard Force, a militia belonging to the ethnic Karen minority.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) The Associated Press GOMA, Congo -- Residents in eastern Congo’s largest city, Goma, woke up on Monday morning afraid and uncertain about who was in control of the area after Rwanda-backed rebels claimed to have captured the city , as their fight with Congolese security forces escalated in recent days in one of Africa’s longest wars . Gunshots rang out across Goma overnight before dozens of men in military uniform were seen early Monday morning marching with their guns into the city, which is the capital of North Kivu province. It was unclear if the men — who were cheered on by some residents from the roadside — were the M23 rebels. The Congolese government has not confirmed the reported takeover. The M23 rebel group, which neighboring Rwanda backs, is one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region in the decades-long conflict . The rebels temporarily took over Goma in 2012 and resurfaced in late 2021, with increasing support from Rwanda, according to Congo’s government and United Nations experts. Rwanda has denied such support. Analysts have warned the latest escalation of hostilities could further destabilize the region, which is already home to one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises with more than 6 million people displaced. More than a third of North Kivu's population are among the displaced, according to a U.N. report. In a statement late Sunday, the U.N. Security Council called on the M23 to immediately reverse its advances. “The members of the Security Council condemned the ongoing flagrant disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC … and that the M23 put an end to the establishment of parallel administrations in the DRC territory,” the statement added, referring to Congo's other name. The rebels announced early Monday they had captured the city just as a deadline they gave to Congolese security forces to surrender their weapons was about to expire. The rebels asked the Congolese military to assemble at the central stadium and urged residents to remain calm. Congolese government officials have said the country is “in a war situation” and accused Rwanda of committing “a frontal aggression (and) a declaration of war.\" The country severed ties with Rwanda over the weekend. Recent attempts at diplomatic talks between the two countries failed. The reported advance into Goma is the culmination of a prolonged battle between the rebels and the Congolese security forces during which several towns fell to the rebels . On Sunday, hundreds of residents marched in the heat and through the night along roads with heavy traffic as they tried to flee Goma into Rwanda, carrying their babies, clothes and other belongings on their backs and heads. “We are fleeing because we saw soldiers on the border with Rwanda throwing bombs and shooting,” said Safi Shangwe, who was among those on the move. The U.N.’s special representative for Congo Bintou Keita told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council late Sunday that “we are trapped,” with the airport shut down and roads blocked. At least 13 U.N. peacekeepers have been killed in the hostilities in the past week. The U.N. peacekeeping force, also known as MONUSCO, entered Congo more than two decades ago and has around 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground. The Uruguayan army, in Goma serving with the U.N. peacekeeping mission, said in a statement on the social platform X late Sunday that more than 100 Congolese soldiers were laying down their weapons. —- Associated Press journalists Monika Pronczuk and Wilson McMakin in Dakar, Senegal; Edith M.

A prisoner swap between the U.S. and Afghanistan last week freed two Americans in exchange for a Taliban figure, Khan Muhammad. The deal to release Ryan Corbett and William McKenty was brokered by Joe Biden ’s administration before he left office. But two more Americans, George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi , remain in Taliban custody. The Taliban have not revealed how many foreigners are behind bars. “Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has been reported,” Rubio said in a post on X Saturday. “If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on (Osama) bin Laden.” The Taliban’s ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, said it was the policy of the Afghan government to resolve issues peacefully through dialogue, and he fired a warning shot at Rubio. “In the face of pressure and aggression, the jihad (struggle) of the Afghan nation in recent decades is a lesson that everyone should learn from.” The Taliban fought U.S. and NATO forces for two decades, eventually returning to power in August 2021 amid a deadly and chaotic withdrawal of foreign troops. Shaheen was part of the Taliban’s negotiating team in Doha to secure a peace deal for Afghanistan. He said the recent release of another foreigner, Canadian David Lavery, from an Afghan jail had been achieved through mediation by the “friendly country of Qatar” and positive interactions with the Taliban government on such cases. Earlier Monday, Canada’s foreign minister, Melanie Joly, said she had spoken with Lavery upon his arrival in Qatar. “He is in good spirits,” Joly wrote on X, thanking Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani for helping facilitate Lavery’s release.

(AP Photo/Vanessa Gera) The Associated Press OSWIECIM, Poland -- The 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops is being marked on Monday at the site of the former death camp, a ceremony that is widely being treated as the last major observance that any notable number of survivors will be able to attend. Nazi German forces murdered some 1.1 million people at the site in southern Poland, which was under German occupation during World War II. Most of the victims were Jews killed on an industrial scale in gas chambers, but the Germans also murdered many Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, gay people and others who were targeted for elimination in the Nazi racial ideology. Polish President Andrzej Duda, whose nation lost 6 million citizens during the war, placed a candle at the Death Wall, where prisoners were executed, among them Poles who resisted the occupation of their country. He was surrounded by elderly survivors of the camp assisted by family members. In all, the Germans murdered 6 million Jews from all over Europe, annihilating two-thirds of Europe's Jews and one-third of all Jews worldwide. In 2005, the United Nations designated Jan. 27 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Later in the day, world leaders and royalty will join with elderly camp survivors, the youngest of whom are in their 80s. Politicians, however, have not been asked to speak this year. Due to the advanced age of the survivors, organizers are choosing to make them the center of the observances. Among the leaders expected to attend are Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Germany has never sent both of its highest state representatives to the observances before, according to German news agency dpa. It is a sign of Germany's continued commitment to take responsibility for the nation's crimes, even amid a growing far-right movement that would like to forget. French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will also attend, while Britain's King Charles III will also be there along with kings and queens from Spain, Denmark and Norway. Russian representatives were in the past central guests at the anniversary observances in recognition of the Soviet liberation of the camp on Jan. 27, 1945, and the huge losses suffered by Soviet forces in the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany. But they have not been welcome since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. —— Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

(Jeon Heon Kyun/Pool Photo via AP) The Associated Press SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has become the country's first leader to be indicted, less than two weeks after he was the first to be detained. The impeached, jailed president, who had been holed up in his presidential compound for weeks after issuing a shocking martial law decree last month, now faces rebellion charges that are punishable by the death penalty or life in prison. It's part of a tortuous saga that has plunged South Korea into political turmoil and further riven an already divided society. And it's not the only legal headache Yoon faces. A separate proceeding will determine whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. As Seoul prepares for double court hearings, continuing chaotic protests and increasingly harsh rhetoric from pro-and anti-Yoon forces, here's what to expect next: Yoon will stay in jail. He will be brought from a detention facility to a Seoul court for hearings in the rebellion trial, which is expected to last about six months. Prosecutors say that Yoon directed a rebellion when he briefly imposed martial law on Dec. 3. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but not on charges of rebellion or treason. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders have already been arrested and indicted on alleged rebellion, abuse of power and other charges related to the martial law decree. Meanwhile, rival protests look likely to continue in downtown Seoul. After a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon’s detention, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police detained 46 protesters. Yoon also has to worry about the Constitutional Court, which has until June to determine whether to formally dismiss or reinstate him as president. Observers expect a ruling to come sooner than the deadline. In the cases of two past impeached presidents, Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 and Park Geun-hye in 2016, the court spent 63 days and 91 days respectively before determining to reinstate Roh and dismiss Park. If the Constitutional Court removes Yoon from office, an election to choose his successor must be held within two months. Recent public surveys show that governing and opposition party candidates are running neck-and-neck in a possible presidential by-election race. Both are promising that this is just the beginning. Shin Dong-wook, a spokesperson for the governing conservative People Power Party, is warning that prosecutors will face unspecified legal and political consequences for their “wrong indictment” of Yoon. Yoon’s defense team says the prosecutors who indicted the president are trying to curry favor with political forces who want Yoon gone. They called the indictment “a shame in the history of South Korean prosecutors.” The main opposition liberal Democratic Party, which led Yoon’s Dec. 14 impeachment, called his indictment and arrest “the beginning of the punishment of the ringleader of a rebellion.” Party spokesperson Han Min-soo warned Yoon to stop what he called his attempt to incite far-right supporters based on “groundless delusion.” Yoon has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing and says his declaration of martial law was a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly, which obstructed his agenda. After declaring martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to unanimously vote down Yoon’s decree, forcing his Cabinet to lift it. The martial law imposition, the first of its kind in South Korea in more than four decades, lasted only six hours. But it evoked painful memories of the military-backed rulers who used martial law and emergency decrees to suppress opponents in the 1960s through the '80s. ___ Klug reported from Tokyo.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong) The Associated Press HONG KONG -- Manufacturing slowed in China in January for the first time in four months as workers began leaving assembly lines to travel to their hometowns for Lunar New Year holidays. The National Bureau of Statistics said its purchasing managers index, based on a survey of factory managers, slipped to 49.1 in January from 50.1 the month before. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion. Under 50 signals a contraction in activity. New orders and production also contracted. A parallel purchasing managers’ index for the non-manufacturing sector, which covers construction and services, fell to 50.2 points from 52.2 in December. The slide in factory activity was partly due to the approach of the holidays, said Zhao Qinghe, a bureau senior statistician. China's most important festival, this year public holidays will begin Tuesday and continue until Feb. 4. Millions of Chinese leave the cities to travel back home for a rare break with family during the holidays, which tend to distort economic data early in the year. China’s economy grew at a 5% annual pace in 2024, hitting the government’s target thanks to strong exports and stimulus measures. While activity slowed this month, it's likely to pick up again thanks to the government's efforts, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a commentary. “But the disappointing PMI data underscores the difficulty policymakers face in achieving a sustained recovery in growth,\" she said. She noted that the PMI for construction also fell. “This is disappointing, and suggests that fiscal support may be struggling to offset the broader pressures weighing on construction activity,” Huang said. The outlook for exports also remains uncertain, given threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to raise tariffs on imports from China. Related Topics China",

(Son Hyung-joo/Yonhap via AP, File) The Associated Press SEOUL, South Korea -- The first report on last month’s Jeju Air crash in South Korea confirmed bird strikes in the plane's engines, though officials haven’t determined the cause of the accident that killed all but two of the 181 people on board . The preliminary accident report released Monday said feathers and bird blood stains were found in both engines. “The samples were sent to specialized organizations for DNA analysis, and a domestic organization identified them as belonging to Baikal Teals,” the report said, referring to a migratory duck. The report also said the plane's black box stopped recording about 4 minutes before the crash. South Korea earlier announced that it will remove a concrete structure at the end of the airport's runway that was involved in the crash. Some experts have said that Muan International Airport’s localizer — a set of antennas in a concrete structure that guide aircraft during landings — likely made the crash of the Jeju Air plane worse. The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the airport’s runaway on Dec. 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into the concrete structure and bursting into flames. Many observers said the structure should have been made with lighter materials that could break more easily upon impact. Investigators have said that air traffic controllers warned the pilot about possible bird strikes two minutes before the aircraft issued a distress signal confirming that a bird strike had occurred, after which the pilot attempted an emergency landing.

        "full_content": "A destroyed Israeli kibbutz on the Lebanese border starts to pick up the pieces. Who will return? Residents of northern Israel are surveying damage and trying to rebuild after the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah By MELANIE LIDMAN Associated Press January 27, 2025, 1:02 AM 1:06 A mannequin with military clothing used as a decoy during the 14-month war between Hezbollah and Israel stands in Kibbutz Manara, on the border with Lebanon, northern Israel, Jan. 5, 2025. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit) The Associated Press KIBBUTZ MANARA, Israel -- Kibbutz Manara in northern Israel is so close to the Lebanese border that patrons of a local pub joke, with gallows humor, that the militant group Hezbollah could see if they were eating sunflower seeds or potato chips with their beers. The proximity made Manara so vulnerable in the war between Israel and Hezbollah that rockets and explosive drones damaged the majority of homes, turning the tiny community into a symbol of the heavy price of fighting. The kibbutz's 300 residents were among the 60,000 Israelis evacuated by the government from communities along the Lebanese border during the 14-month war. A tenuous ceasefire has largely held, though it was tested on Sunday as a 60-day deadline passed for Israel and Hezbollah to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon. Health officials in Lebanon said at least 22 people were killed by Israeli fire when demonstrators attempted to enter villages still under Israeli control. Israel says it is committed to withdrawing but says the process will take additional time. For now, residents of Israel's north are taking their time returning, uncertain when — or if — they will go back to shattered communities. Many wonder what future they can have in a place so exposed to violence. The vast majority of displaced families still haven't returned home. In hard-hit places like Manara, some who have ventured back have found unlivable, blackened homes. It will take years to rebuild. “We are trying to understand what we can fix, what we can do better, how we can prepare for the next round (of fighting),\" said Igor Abramovich, who remained in Manara during the war and believes it's just a matter of time before fighting erupts. All homes on the ridge facing Lebanon are destroyed, with gaping holes left by missile strikes or fires that burned so hot that cars partly melted. Because the kibbutz is so exposed, 70 meters (yards) from the border in some places, firefighters sometimes couldn’t respond to the blazes. Instead, the emergency squad was forced to watch on security cameras as fires burned. Hezbollah began launching rockets and missiles toward Israeli border communities on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the deadly Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza. Soon after, Israel evacuated dozens of towns, villages and kibbutzim along the border, including Manara. In Lebanon, at the height of the war, more than 1 million people were displaced, and reconstruction will take years there as well. Piles of rubble that were once homes can be seen in towns across the border. Hezbollah rockets killed 77 people in Israel, more than half of them civilians. No one was killed in Manara. Israeli air and ground assaults killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians. Israel made returning the displaced residents to their homes an aim in its war against Hezbollah and has promised incentives to entice them back. The return has been slow, in part because many residents are skeptical of the government's pledges to ensure their safety and because much work remains to rehabilitate communities. Manara is prone to howling winds and snow usually once a winter, attracting a hardy, close-knit group of people. Such remote kibbutzim were an integral element of the Israeli pioneer ethos, and Israel as a fledgling state once relied on them to protect its borders in the face of threats from neighboring Arab countries. Those threats appeared to have waned until Hamas attacked into southern Israel and Israeli authorities assessed that Hezbollah was planning a similar cross-border raid in the north. The war was a clear reminder for Israelis that the country still depends on the border communities and needs to ensure their viability so that the country doesn't collapse toward its center. Many in Manara are determined to return and restore their homes. “It’s really a physical thing. They miss the air here,” said Orna Weinberg, 58, who has lived on the kibbutz her entire life. Weinberg was displaced to a town about 45 minutes south, but she coordinated with the army and returned to Manara almost every day during the war, helping other evacuated residents who asked her to save photo albums, transfer the kibbutz’s archives or carry out other tasks to keep the community from falling apart. Now she’s involved in coordinating Manara's rehabilitation, both physical and emotional. She and Abramovich spend hours walking through the kibbutz with appraisers for dif...",

        "full_content": "Dubai's ceaseless boom is putting strains on its residents Skyscraper-studded Dubai has been on a hot streak for the last five years — and some are starting to get burned By JON GAMBRELL Associated Press January 27, 2025, 12:58 AM 1:06 Vehicles crawl through the Sheikh Zayed Road during rush hour, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Jan. 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Altaf Qadri) The Associated Press DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Skyscraper-studded Dubai has been on a hot streak for the last five years — and some residents are starting to feel burned. The city-state has seen record-breaking real estate transactions and as more and more people come to live there, and its state-owned airline Emirates is booking record earnings . But all that growth comes with strains for the city's population. Traffic feels worse than ever on Dubai's roads. The price of housing continues to spike even with new real estate projects being announced almost daily. Caught in the middle are both its Emirati citizens and the vast population of foreigners who power its economy — sparking rare public expressions of concern. “Dubai is on steroids but affordability risks are increasing,” warned Hasnain Malik in a starkly titled report he wrote for the global data firm Tellimer, where he's a managing director. Under Dubai's current plans, the city aims to have 5.8 million residents by 2040, adding more than half its current estimated population in just 15 years. Since 1980, its population has already soared from around 255,000 to around 3.8 million. Real estate lit the fire in Dubai's growth in 2002, when the desert sheikdom began allowing foreigners to own property. After sharp falls during both the 2008-2009 financial crisis and Dubai's brief coronavirus lockdown , prices have been soaring. Today, average prices per square foot are at all-time highs, according to Property Monitor. Rental prices increased as much as 20% in key neighborhoods last year, with further rises likely this year, with some residents moving to communities further out in the desert, the real estate firm Engel & Völkers said. Even before the boom, some people who worked in Dubai chose to live in the neighboring emirate of Sharjah, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the city's downtown, or further away. Some 1 million commuters from other emirates jam the 12-lane Sheikh Zayed Road that runs through the center of the city and other highways every day, as studies suggest that as many as four out of five employees drive to work alone. That traffic has only intensified with Dubai's new arrivals. While the rest of the world saw as much as a 4% increase in the number of registered vehicles in the last two years, the city's Road and Transportation Authority says there's been a 10% increase in the number of vehicles. So many vehicles have been registered that the city has had to make license plates longer. And while the city keeps building new flyovers and other road improvements, more cars are coming from more directions than ever before. “Dubai is very attractive, more and more people are coming,” said Thomas Edelmann, the founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, which advocates about traffic issues. “I think it’s easier to get people quickly to come to Dubai and to convince them about Dubai, then to build a new intersection or a new highway.” Congestion has got so bad that it's driving even prominent Emiratis to break their customary silence on public affairs. Habib Al Mulla, a prominent Emirati lawyer, wrote on the social platform X in December that while authorities were working on congestion, the problem demanded “a set of immediate and long-term mechanisms.” He followed up by publishing an opinion piece twice mentioning “congestion” as being among “pressing issues\" for global cities like Dubai. While phrased in mild language, Al Mulla’s comments represented rare public criticism in the United Arab Emirates, where speech is tightly controlled by criminal law and social norms favor raising issues at a “majlis” — a semiprivate setting convened by a traditional ruler. “The concentration of wealth and opportunities created in global cities may cause income inequality that pushes out lower-income residents,” Al Mulla warned in the English-language Khaleej Times newspaper on Jan. 15 . “The problem becomes acute when the wealth and opportunities remain inaccessible to segments of the national population who witness the city’s allure being seized by outsiders. This may carry significant social risks, if not mitigated.” Then there's demographic concerns as the Emirati share of the population dwindles. While the number of citizens isn't public, a back-of-the-envelope, informal calculation shared for years by experts suggests Emirati citizens represent around 10% of the country's overall population of more than 9 million people, a number that's likely falling as foreigners rush in. In December, sermon scripts issued for the Dec. 13 Friday's pr...",

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana) The Associated Press DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israel on Monday began allowing thousands of Palestinians to return to the heavily destroyed north of the Gaza Strip for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas , in accordance with a fragile ceasefire. The opening was delayed for two days over a dispute between Hamas and Israel, which said the militant group had changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Mediators resolved the dispute overnight . Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters for over a year are eager to return to their homes -- even knowing that they have likely been damaged or destroyed . Many had feared Israel would make their exodus permanent, and expressed similar concerns about an idea floated by President Donald Trump to resettle large numbers of Palestinians in Egypt and Jordan. Ismail Abu Matter, a father of four who had waited for three days before crossing with his family, described scenes of jubilation on the other side, with people singing, praying and crying as they were reunited with relatives. “It’s the joy of return,” said Abu Matter, whose family was among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. “We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.” Hamas said the return was “a victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation and transfer plans.” The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the militants’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the fighting. Israel ordered the wholescale evacuation of the north in the opening days of the war and sealed it off shortly after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled to the south in October 2023, while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting and the worst destruction of the war . Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to enforce the ceasefire, and that anyone violating it or threatening Israeli forces “will bear the full cost.” “We will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,” he wrote on the platform X. Israel had delayed the opening of the crossing, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. It also accused Hamas of failing to provide information on whether the remaining hostages set to be freed in the first phase are alive or dead. Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement by not opening the crossing. The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, announced early Monday that an agreement had been reached to release Yehoud along with two other hostages before Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the hostage release — which will include female soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday. That release will be in addition to the one already set for next Saturday, when three hostages should be released. Hamas also handed over a list of required information about the hostages to be released in the ceasefire’s six-week first phase. Starting at 7 a.m., Palestinians were allowed to cross on foot without inspection through part of the so-called Netzarim corridor , a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles was to open later with an inspection mechanism, the details of which were not immediately known. Under the first phase of the ceasefire, which runs until early March, Hamas is to free a total of 33 hostages in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The militants have released seven hostages, including four female soldiers, in the current ceasefire, in exchange for more than 300 prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. The second — and far more difficult — phase of the agreement has not yet been negotiated. Hamas says i...",

(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) The Associated Press OSWIECIM, Poland -- A U.S.-based organization is transforming the house of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss into a research center devoted to fighting extremism, and is introducing it to the public on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on Monday . The house, which belonged to a Polish military family before Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland, lies next to the site of the former death camp, now the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. “My dream, and those of our colleagues, is that every visitor, every fellow, every academic that comes here takes action to fight extremism and antisemitism wherever they come from,\" said Mark Wallace, the CEO of the Counter Extremism Project. His group bought the house from a private family and is creating the Auschwitz Center on Hate, Extremism and Radicalization in the house. It opened its doors to reporters on the eve of the anniversary commemorations, showing them the rooms in the three-story house that still need to be renovated. The project is being launched in partnership with the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and under the patronage of UNESCO. Prominent architect Daniel Libeskind is also a collaborator. The house was featured in the Oscar-winning film “The Zone of Interest,” which depicts the life of Höss, his wife Hedwig and their five children in the house just next to the concentration camp. As commandant from 1940 to 1944, Höss orchestrated the industrial-scale slaughter at the camp, where gas was used to murder Jews. He was tried by a Polish court and was executed by hanging at the site of the concentration camp in 1947. The Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum is holding observances on Monday for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the camp by Soviet forces.",

By The Associated Press January 26, 2025, 2:16 PM 1:06 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko speaks to the media after voting in presidential elections in Minsk, Belarus, Sunday, Jan. 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Pavel Bednyakov) The Associated Press Belarus has “unilaterally” freed an American woman from detention, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Sunday, as the Kremlin-allied country held an orchestrated election poised to give strongman President Alexander Lukashenko yet another term on top of his three decades in power. Rubio’s post on the X social network identified the U.S. citizen as Anastassia Nuhfer. It said she was detained during former President Joe Biden’s tenure, but did not specify when or why. Rubio's statement came following waves of prisoner releases by Lukashenko, often dubbed “Europe’s last dictator.” Belarus’ oldest rights group, Viasna, says that over 1,250 people remain in detention over their opposition to the authorities. Lukashenko’s opponents, many of whom are imprisoned or exiled abroad by his unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech , have called Sunday’s election a sham. The last election in 2020 triggered months of mass protests unprecedented in Belarusian history. The U.S. State Department said later on Sunday that Nuhfer was detained in early December 2024. It said that earlier this month, a consular officer from Washington was granted rare access to an American detainee in Belarus. A former high-ranking Belarusian diplomat told AP that Nuhfer's arrest was linked to the 2020 protests, although he did not give details. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, said that Lukashenko himself offered to free the U.S. citizen “as a gesture of goodwill,” while declining to release any Belarusian opposition and rights activists. Nuhfer’s release took the public and even Belarusian activists by surprise. Her name hadn’t been publicly released and hadn’t featured on lists of political prisoners. Pavel Sapelka of the Viasna rights group, said that he and his colleagues had been unaware of her arrest or its circumstances. Lukashenko’s support for the war in Ukraine has led to the rupture of Belarus’ ties with the U.S. and the EU, ending his gamesmanship of using the West to try to win more subsidies from the Kremlin. But Artyom Shraybman, a Belarus expert with the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center, predicted that Minsk could try to ease its total dependence on Russia after the election, by again seeking to reach out to the West. “Lukashenko’s interim goal is to use the election to confirm his legitimacy and try to overcome his isolation in order to at least start a conversation with the West about easing sanctions,” Shraybman said. It was unclear what, if any, concessions Minsk has requested in exchange for releasing the U.S. citizen. Related Topics Belarus Protests",

By The Associated Press January 26, 2025, 12:57 PM 1:06 NATO naval vessels are docked at Ofelia Plads in Copenhagen Harbor, Sunday, Jan. 26, 2025, as the vessel A803 will participate in NATO's enhanced operation, Baltic Sentry, in the Baltic Sea to protect critical infrastructure such as wires and cables on the seabed. (Ida Marie Odgaard/Ritzau Scanpix via AP) The Associated Press RIGA, Latvia -- Swedish prosecutors announced Sunday night that they have opened a preliminary investigation into suspected aggravated “sabotage” and ordered the detention of a vessel in the Baltic Sea suspected of damaging an underwater fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland earlier that day. “Several authorities, including the National Police Operations Department, the Coast Guard and the Armed Forces, are involved in the investigation,” said Mats Ljungqvist, senior prosecutor at the National Security Unit, according to a press release. The Swedish Coast Guard confirmed to the newspaper Expressen that they were on site near the vessel which the paper identified as the Malta-flagged Vezhen, at anchor near the port of Karlskrona. “We are directly on site with the seized ship and are taking measures as decided by the prosecutor,” said Mattias Lindholm, spokesperson for the Coast Guard. According to data from Vesselfinder, the vessel departed from the Russian port of Ust-Luga several days earlier and was navigating between Gotland and Latvia at the time the damage was suspected of having occurred. Latvia's state-run radio and TV center said Sunday that it recorded disruptions in data transmission on the cable running from the town of Ventspils to the Swedish island of Gotland, and concluded there was a rupture. The media organization said it was able to operate using other data transmission routes, while it was taking steps to have the cable repaired. “At the moment, there is reason to believe that the cable is significantly damaged and that the damage is caused by external influences,” Vineta Sprugaine, head of corporate communications at LVRTC, was quoted as saying by the LSM state broadcaster. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa wrote on X that her government was “working together with our Swedish Allies and NATO on investigating the incident, including to patrolling the area, as well as inspecting the vessels that were in the area.” Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X that at least one cable belonging to a “Latvian entity” was believed to have been damaged and that he has been “in close contact” with Siliņa during the day Sunday. Sunday's rupture follows a string of incidents that have heightened fears of Russian sabotage and spying in the strategic region. There have been previous incidents reported of ruptures of data cables running on the Baltic sea bed, allegedly linked to Russia’s shadow fleet — hundreds of aging tankers of uncertain ownership that are dodging sanctions and keeping oil revenue coming into the country. Earlier this month, NATO began a new mission dubbed “Baltic Sentry” which included frigates, maritime patrol aircraft and a fleet of naval drones to provide “enhanced surveillance and deterrence” in the Baltic Sea which the transatlantic alliance says is to protect undersea cables and pipelines.

(AP Photo/Pavel Bednyakov) The Associated Press BRUSSELS -- The European Union rejected the election in Belarus on Sunday as illegitimate and threatened new sanctions . Belarus held an orchestrated vote virtually guaranteed to give 70-year-old autocratic President Alexander Lukashenko yet another term on top of his three decades in power. “Today’s sham election in Belarus has been neither free, nor fair,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos said in a joint statement. “The relentless and unprecedented repression of human rights, restrictions to political participation and access to independent media in Belarus, have deprived the electoral process of any legitimacy,\" Kallas and Kos said. They urged the Belarusian government to release political prisoners, estimating their number at more than 1,000, including an employee of the EU delegation in Belarus' capital, Minsk. Kallas and Kos said that the decision to invite observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe only 10 days ago prevented the group from monitoring the full electoral process. “For these reasons, as well as the involvement of the Belarusian regime in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and its hybrid attacks against its neighbours, the EU will continue imposing restrictive and targeted measures” against the Belarusian government, the EU officials said. They didn't elaborate on what eventual new sanctions would target, or provide a time frame. Kallas and some EU foreign ministers are expected to meet Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Sunday night in Brussels for an informal, closed-door dinner.",

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) The Associated Press VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis warned of the “scourge of antisemitism” in his Angelus prayer on Sunday, the eve of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, noting it marks 80 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. “The horror of the extermination of millions of Jewish people and others of different faiths during those years must never be forgotten or denied,” Francis said, citing the example of Hungarian-born poet Edith Bruck, who lives in Rome. He noted that many Christians were also killed in Nazi concentration camps, “among whom there were numerous martyrs.” “I renew my appeal for everyone to work together to eradicate the scourge of anti-Semitism, along with every form of discrimination and religious persecution,” Francis said. “Together, let us build a more fraternal, just world, educating young people to have hearts open to all, in the spirit of fraternity, forgiveness, and peace,” he added. The pontiff also launched an appeal for an end to the civil war in Sudan, which began in April 2023, saying it is causing “the most severe humanitarian crisis in the world, with dramatic consequences even in South Sudan.” The pope also expressed concern for the situation in Colombia’s Catatumbo region, where many civilians have been killed by clashes between armed groups, which have forced over 30,000 people to leave their homes.

(AP Photo/Ivan Valencia) The Associated Press CALI, Colombia -- From time to time, Gustavo Arbeláez faces relatives whose losses were caused by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the powerful guerrilla group he was part of during Colombia’s five-decade armed conflict. Tears in their eyes, victims name their loved ones and reprimand him: They had dreams and now they’re gone. “I have never regretted being a guerrilla member,” said Arbeláez, who signed a divisive peace pact with the government alongside 13,600 FARC fighters in 2016. “But I now see that those of us who fought our country’s war lost sight of what life means.” The fight among leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries, drug lords and government forces left more than 450,000 people killed and 124,000 disappeared. These figures are on par with other conflicts in Latin America , where thousands have vanished under similar circumstances. In Colombia, though, a peculiar thing happened. Aiming to heal long-time wounds and build new paths toward reconciliation, dozens of former rebels, officials, forensic anthropologists and religious leaders now work side-by-side in finding their country’s disappeared. The 2016 pact earned then-President Juan Manuel Santos a Nobel Peace Prize , but neither he nor his successors have fully addressed endemic violence , displacement and inequality — issues that helped spark Colombia’s conflict in the 1960s. Since he came into office in 2022, the rebel-turned-president who was sworn in as the country’s first leftist leader, Gustavo Petro, has pushed for “total peace .” His goal is to demobilize all rebels and drug trafficking gangs, but even as a ceasefire was carried out, negotiations with Colombia’s remaining guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) , are in crisis and violence escalated . Simultaneously, FARC hold-out groups and trafficking mafias continue to affect the country. “A peace accord is not only a matter of setting down arms,” said the Rev. Arturo Arrieta, who oversees human rights initiatives in Palmira, a city in southwestern Colombia where efforts to exhume unidentified remains at a church-administered cemetery are underway. “There’s a delay on the implementation of the accord, it’s underfunded and, although certain mechanisms are working, more actions are needed,” he added. The peace pact established three crucial institutions for searching efforts: the Truth Commission ; the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, which encourages offenders to confess their crimes and make restitution actions in exchange for not serving any jail time; and the Search Unit for Disappeared Persons , which traces disappearances within the conflict, conducts exhumations and returns loved ones' remains to hurting relatives like Doris Tejada, whose son Óscar Morales disappeared in 2007. “It’s been 17 years and still hurts,” said Tejada, who found Morales’ remains in 2024. “I asked God for help because it was difficult to see his bones. We still mourn.” Morales vanished near the border with Venezuela, where he had traveled from a city neighboring Bogotá to earn money selling clothes. Tejada later learned that he became a “ false positive ,\" one of the 6,402 civilians who were slain by the military and intentionally registered as rebels during the conflict. Officials have apologized for the killings and some soldiers involved have been sentenced to prison, but many remain reluctant to acknowledge that the military committed war crimes as serious as those carried out by rebels. “I’ve been very vocal about this,” said Tejada, who tattooed her son’s face on her arm to keep him present. “If this will go unpunished, I want everyone to know that what I cared about the most was rescuing my son’s body and giving him a Christian burial.” Arbeláez joined FARC in the 1980s in Valle del Cauca, a highly affected region during the conflict. According to him, as a university leader his life was threatened, so he chose the path of arms. “None of us decided, from a young age, to become paramilitary leaders, rebels, drug dealers or to run a hitman’s organization,” he said. “Certain circumstances led us to embrace those decisions and no one owns the truth, so we are still trying to understand what made us become part of a conflict that drove us to kill one another.” Government forces and ...",

(AP Photo/Silvio La Rosa) The Associated Press AYACUCHO, Perú -- The easiest thing might have been to let go. To refresh the flowers at her husband’s grave and find comfort in retrieving his bones, a milestone in a country where 20,000 people disappeared between 1980 and 2000. Lidia Flores chose a different path, though: to search for others who also went missing during Peru's most violent period. “I can’t stay calm when others, like I did, are crying,” Flores said from her home in Ayacucho, a Peruvian city whose name translates as “nook of the dead” from the Quechua language. “They are searching and I must be there for them.” Thousands more have disappeared thought Latin America under dictatorships , during armed conflicts or due to organized crime . Their wives, mothers and daughters have historically fought for justice, but Flores’ case is distinctive because even after finding her husband’s remains 40 years ago, her loss led her to commit to a greater cause. For several years, she has presided over the National Association of Relatives of Detained and Disappeared Persons of Peru. Known for its Spanish initials, Anfasep , it was founded in 1983 and has about 140 members who advocate for truth and reparations. “Sometimes I feel at ease, but then I wonder, why did this happen?” said Flores, who Peruvians rarely address by name. Most call her “mami” or “madrecita,” an affectionate Spanish word derived from “mother,” as if she cared for them all. “I won’t let go because I made a commitment,” she added. “For as long as I live, I will demand justice for all and find out why my husband was killed.” Soon after Flores last saw him alive, Felipe Huamán was detained by members of the military dressed as civilians outside his house in July 1984. Flores found his remains a month later, guided by a stranger who saw a corpse matching his description. Only days had passed since he was thrown down a hill, but stray dogs had gnawed at the remains. Flores took her 2-month-old baby out of her shawl, wrapped what was left of Huamán and climbed uphill, her baby in her arms, her husband’s bones on her back. She arrived at the prosecutor’s office and requested a death certificate to bury him, but an official told her: “His body is not whole anymore. Throw him into the river or burn what’s left of him and find your peace.” So she wrapped up the bones, went home and bribed a grave digger to bury Huamán at midnight, as she peeked and wept behind a tree. Stories like hers are part of the aftermath of a brutal fight between the Peruvian government and the insurgency of Sendero Luminoso (or Shining Path), a Communist organization that claimed to seek social transformation through an armed revolution. Founded in the 1970s by Abimael Guzman , the group turned violent a decade later. Older Peruvians still tell tales about donkeys strapped with explosives detonating in crowds, bombs placed under streetlamps to plunge cities into darkness and massacres that wiped out entire families. The terror, though, was not merely unleashed by the insurgents. The armed forces were equally responsible for deaths and human rights violations. Hundreds of men — many of them innocent — were captured by the military , often to face torture and execution. Others were slain and buried in mass graves by insurgents seeking to control communities by spreading fear. Although hundreds of people have disappeared for other motives since then, the Truth Commission said this was the most violent period in Peru’s history. More than 69,000 people are counted as “fatal victims” — about 20,000 classified as “disappeared” and the rest killed by insurgents or the military. “In many ways, Peru is still dealing with the repercussions of the political violence from the late 20th century,” said Miguel La Serna, a history professor at the University of North Carolina. “Whole generations of adult men disappeared and that impacted the demographics in these communities. People moved out to escape the violence and some never returned,” he added. “And that’s to say nothing of the social, collective trauma that people experienced.” Those unsure of what happened to their relatives wandered the streets asking for clues and listened to radio news reports. Every time a discovery of remains was announced, they headed out to those locations and turned over corpses, hoping to spot a familiar face. “Pig and dogs ate the bodies, but we got used to that,” said Adelina García, whose 2...",

(AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi) The Associated Press Israel accused Hamas of violating a fragile ceasefire by changing the order of hostages it has released, stopping thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday. Under the fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza on foot through the so-called Netzarim corridor bisecting Gaza. Israel said another hostage, the female civilian Arbel Yehoud, was supposed to have been released ahead of the four soldiers freed on Saturday . Separately, a senior Hamas official said Palestinians would never accept U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that most of Gaza’s population should be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere , including in Egypt and Jordan. Meanwhile, two people were killed and nine others wounded after Israeli forces fired on the crowd, local Palestinian health officials said Sunday. The ceasefire came after 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas. The war broke out after Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 people. Israel’s retaliatory military operation has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children , according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. According to U.N. agencies, more than 13,000 children have been killed, an estimated 25,000 wounded, and at least 25,000 hospitalized for malnutrition . Here is the latest: TEL AVIV, Israel — Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both want Israel to establish Jewish settlements in Gaza, supported Trump's remarks, calling it “voluntary emigration.\" Palestinians and many of their supporters view it as code for ethnic cleansing. In a post on X Sunday, Smotrich called the idea of “helping (Palestinians) find other places to start new, good lives” great and said he would work with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to that end. Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu’s government over the current ceasefire in Gaza, said Trump’s remarks gave Israel the green light to move ahead on “voluntary emigration.” “When the president of the world’s largest superpower brings it up himself, the government of Israel should implement it,” he said in a statement. Netanyahu has said building Jewish settlements in Gaza is not realistic. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains a blockade with Egypt on the territory. JERUSALEM — The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says its staff was directed to vacate the premises by Thursday. Israel passed legislation last year cutting all ties with the agency and barring it from operating in its territory. It says the agency, which is the main provider of aid in the Gaza Strip, has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. In a statement Sunday, the agency, known as UNRWA, said the order to vacate “is in contradiction to international law obligations of U.N. member states,” including Israel. “United Nations premises are inviolable and enjoy privileges and immunities under the United Nations Charter.\" UNRWA closed its east Jerusalem headquarters last May after Israeli protesters set fire to its perimeter. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Bassem Naim said that “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction,\" the Palestinian people will never agree to such a proposal. He also said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before” if Israel lifts its blockade . DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces fired on the crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday. Those killed included a child, according to the Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza as part of the ceasefire, which came into force last Sunday, but the military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which are still operating in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.",

(Daniel Vogl/dpa via AP) The Associated Press BERLIN -- Government officials and local residents attended a solemn Mass Sunday to honor a child and a man killed in a knife attack in Germany , an assault that amplified the debate about migration ahead of the Feb. 23 general election. The religious service at the collegiate church in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, was briefly suspended for the tolling of the city’s bells at the exact time that the attack took place on Wednesday, 11:45 a.m. Bavaria governor Markus Söder, Aschaffenburg Mayor Jürgen Herzing and a Muslim leader addressed the congregation that included rescuers, to express grief and disbelief at the loss of lives. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser was also present. The attack is politically sensitive a month before Germany’s national election as migration policy is among the top campaign issues. A 2-year-old boy of Moroccan origin, who was part of a group of kindergarten children, was killed, along with a 41-year-old German man who apparently intervened to protect the children in a city park. The suspect is a 28-year-old former asylum-seeker from Afghanistan who had been told to leave Germany. Officials said he had received psychiatric treatment and there was no immediate indication that he was motivated by extremism. Bavarian officials said two adults and a 2-year-old Syrian girl were also wounded in the attack and hospitalized but there was no danger to their lives.",

        "summary": "Far-right leaders may be paying respects today, but their power reflects the growing threat of genocidal violence.",
        "full_content": "On January 27, 1945, the largest Nazi concentration and extermination camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, was liberated. An estimated 1.3 million people were deported to Auschwitz between 1940 and 1945 and 1.1 million of them were murdered. As Europeans mark the 80th anniversary of this dark chapter of history, their leaders are releasing statements about the “civilisational rupture” the Holocaust represented and the need to “resist this hatred”. Yet, many of these declarations do not seem to take stock of the political reality in Europe, in which the successors of the fascist and Nazi forces behind the Holocaust are now gaining popularity and even taking power. Of course, far-right parties and figures have repeatedly paid their respects to Holocaust victims and pledged to combat anti-Semitism, but that does not mean they have relinquished their Nazi and fascist past. Rather, they have undertaken a strategic realignment which – with the help of the political mainstream – allows them to retain and propagate the same dangerous ideas of white supremacy and hatred. Advertisement So how did we get here? For decades, Europe’s far right openly embraced anti-Semitism. Figures like Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the National Front in France, and Jörg Haider, founder of the Freedom Party in Austria, disrupted the political consensus of post-war Europe by embracing Holocaust denial rhetoric. They were vocal in expressing their hatred but they remained on the margins of political life. However, over the past few decades, and especially with the start of the US-led “war on terror”, the far right gradually shifted its rhetoric towards open Islamophobia. Far-right leaders, like Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, portrayed themselves as defenders of Western civilisation against a new “enemy”: the Muslims. They adopted Christianity – and, symbolically, Judaism – as cultural markers to rally the majority who embrace the “values” of the “Judeo-Christian world” against their contemporary “other”. They played on people’s fears related to globalisation and immigration by using Islamophobic imagery, claiming Muslim communities are a threat and immigration from the East – an invasion. This rhetoric not only reflects the framing of the Muslim world that the “war on terror” imposed but also fits into the narrative that Israel embraced in justifying its continuing oppression and occupation of the Palestinians. It is not surprising then that the far right finally embraced Israel. While in the past, they questioned Israel’s right to exist, they now question a Palestinian state’s right to exist, referring to Palestine as Judea and Samaria. Advertisement In 2010, after a trip by far-right leaders from Austria, Belgium, Germany and Sweden, their parties signed the so-called Jerusalem Declaration, which expressed the commitment of these forces to Israel’s “right to self-defence” from “Islamic forces”. This strategy of swapping anti-Semitic rhetoric and beliefs for Islamophobic ones, while embracing the violence of Israel, has proved to be quite successful. As a result, today, at the 80th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust, the far right is the strongest it has been since World War II. The political landscape of 2022-24 reflects this success. In 2022, Giorgia Meloni and her post-fascist Brothers of Italy won the Italian snap elections; she became the country’s first far-right female prime minister. In the 2023 Dutch elections, Wilders’ far-right party came out first and after months-long negotiations, formed a coalition government. In 2024, Portugal, which had long lacked strong far-right representation, saw the Chega party grow its parliamentary seats from 12 to 50. In France, the National Rally came in third in terms of parliamentary seats but won the popular vote. In the UK, Reform UK became the third largest party with 14 percent of the vote; it is currently polling at 25 percent, one percentage point behind the ruling Labour. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) claimed victory in elections in the state of Thuringia. In Austria, the Freedom Party won the national elections with 29 percent of the vote and is set to lead the government. Advertisement At the European level, the far right was able to form the third-largest group in the European Parliament called the “Patriots for Europe”, following the elections in 2024. They adopted the slogan “Make Europe Great Again”. While the far right’s rise is a victory for its own movements, it also reflects the failures of Europe’s political establishment. Centre-right parties have largely embraced anti-immigration and Islamophobic politics, legitimising these positions rather than challenging them. Meanwhile, centre-left parties have struggled to address these issues effectively, leaving them vulnerable to the so-called culture wars. The mainstream’s failures in government have led to growing socioeconomic discontent, especially among the working class, which the far ri...",

The return, delayed for two days following a dispute between Hamas and Israel over the release of an Israeli captive, is in accordance with a fragile ceasefire deal agreed a week ago. The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever waged on Gaza, and securing the release of captives and prisoners held by Hamas and Israel, respectively. Palestinians, who for all these months had been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters, are eager to return to what is left of their homes, likely damaged or destroyed due to the Israeli assault. Hamas said the return was “a victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the [Israeli] occupation and transfer plans”. Israel had ordered the wholesale evacuation of the north in the opening days of the war in October 2023 and sealed it off shortly after ground troops moved in. Advertisement About a million people fled to the south, while thousands remained in the north, which saw some of the heaviest fighting and the worst destruction caused by the war. Many had feared Israel would make their exodus permanent, and expressed fears of ethnic cleansing after United States President Donald Trump asked Egypt and Jordan to settle Gaza’s Palestinians on their soil.",

The largest marches on Sunday took place in Greece’s two biggest cities, Athens and Thessaloniki. In London, about 500 people demonstrated outside the Greek Embassy in the Holland Park neighbourhood. More protests were staged in Amsterdam, Netherlands; Brussels, Belgium; Berlin and Cologne, Germany; Helsinki, Finland; London, United Kingdom; Nicosia, Cyprus; Reykjavik, Iceland; and Valletta, Malta. The protesters called to demonstrate by victims’ relatives held banners and signs reading “I have no oxygen”, a phrase uttered by a victim, still alive, who called the 112 European emergency number to report the incident on the night of February 28, 2023, when a northbound passenger train collided near Tempe in central Greece with a southbound freight train, which had been placed mistakenly on the same track. Advertisement The demonstrators accused the government of hiding significant evidence, running an opaque investigation and trying to blame the disaster on a stationmaster’s bad decisions. Many believe that at least 30 of the 57 victims survived the initial impact only to die in a fire started not by the high-speed crash but, allegedly, by dangerous chemicals transported by the freight train. Some have accused the government of trying to hide that chemicals were on board. The government denies the allegations. A lengthy investigation and delays by technical experts in producing reports about what caused the fire after the crash have pushed back a trial date. Greek media have reported that it is possible a trial could begin in the coming months if there are no further delays. It is estimated that 50-60 railway and other officials will be put on trial.",

        "summary": "Here are the key developments on the 1,068th day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
        "full_content": "Here is the situation on Monday, January 27: Fighting A barrage of more than 100 Russian drones sparked a fire at an industrial facility in western Ukraine and damaged residential buildings in other regions, Ukrainian officials said. The strikes resulted in two fires at an industrial facility in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region. Kyiv’s regional military administrator Vadym Filashkin said Russian artillery fire on eastern Ukraine killed at least one woman in the city of Pokrovsk and injured four people in the neighbouring Kostiantynivka town. According to Ukrainian military analyst Andriy Ryzhchenko, Pokrovsk is an economic target for Russia. The Ukrainian army said Moscow’s units launched 38 attacks with artillery support at various points against the Ukrainian lines of defence. Ukraine said its armed forces, together with the country’s defence intelligence, repeatedly struck Russia’s Ryazan Oil Refining Company for a second time just two days after its initial overnight attack on the facility. Kyiv said the oil refinery is one of the four largest in the Russian Federation. Russian media reported Moscow’s Defence Ministry as saying its troops captured the settlements of Zelene and Velyka Novosilka in eastern Ukraine. Advertisement Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for a third time in less than a year, replaced the commander of the Khortytsia operational strategic group responsible for defending Pokrovsk, which now risks falling into Russia’s hands. He named Major-General Mykhailo Drapatyi the new commander of ground forces. Politics & Diplomacy Zelensky has urged the world to unite against evil, in comments marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz Nazi death. Zelenskyy, in a news conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu, said Kyiv was willing to supply coal to Transnistria at low prices or even for free if the separatist enclave would supply Ukraine with electricity in return. He also offered to send a team of specialists to help expand the enclave’s power plant electricity output. Hungary was expected to lift its block on the EU prolonging its sanctions on Russia, after weeks of stalling from Prime Minister Viktor Orban, diplomats said. The Institute for the Study of War reported that members of the Kremlin-linked Telegram channel Rybar – including its founder Mikhail Zvinchuk – visited Iraq over the last week in efforts to cultivate Russian influence there. The team is said to have met with multiple Iraqi officials, including Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani. Polish President Andrzej Duda told Al Jazeera that NATO member countries should up their defence spending by at least 3 percent of their GDP to build a security zone against the “rebirth of Russian imperialism”. Exit polls showed Belarusian President Lukashenko, whose administration is a close ally of Russia, was on track to extend his time in power with 87.6 percent of the votes in the country’s presidential election. Lukashenko also said he has “no regrets” about letting Russia use Belarus’ territory to invade Ukraine in 2022. Advertisement",

        "full_content": "By Wafaa Shurafa, Samy Magdy, and Joseph Krauss / AP January 27, 2025 6:31 AM EST DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Tens of thousands of Palestinians streamed into the most heavily destroyed part of the Gaza Strip on Monday as Israel lifted its closure of the north for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas in accordance with a fragile ceasefire . Read More: A Bittersweet Gaza Ceasefire Massive crowds of people walking with their belongings stretched along a main road running next to the coast in a stunning reversal of the mass exodus from the north at the start of the war that many Palestinians had feared Israel would make permanent . Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters for over a year are eager to return to their homes — even though they have likely been damaged or destroyed . Yasmin Abu Amshah, a mother of three, said she walked 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) to reach her home in Gaza City, where she found it damaged but still habitable. She also saw her younger sister for the first time in over a year. “It was a long trip, but a happy one,” she said. “The most important thing is that we returned.” Many saw their return as an act of steadfastness after Israel’s military campaign, which was launched in response to the Hamas militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The return was also seen as a repudiation of U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that large numbers of Palestinians be resettled in Egypt and Jordan. ‘The joy of return’ Ismail Abu Matter, a father of four who waited for three days near the crossing point before moving north with his family, described scenes of jubilation on the other side, with people singing, praying and crying as they were reunited with relatives. “It’s the joy of return,” said Abu Matter, whose relatives were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. “We had thought we wouldn’t return, like our ancestors.” The opening was delayed for two days over a dispute between Hamas and Israel, which said the militant group changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Mediators resolved the dispute overnight . Hamas said the return was “a victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation and transfer plans.” The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in that assault and abducted another 250. Israel responded with an air and ground war that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. In the opening days of the war, Israel ordered the wholescale evacuation of the north and sealed it off shortly after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled to the south in October 2023, while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting and the worst destruction of the war . In all, around 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced. Hostage dispute rattled week-old ceasefire Israel had delayed the opening of the crossing, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. Israel said she should have been released before four young female soldiers, who were freed on Saturday . It also accused Hamas of failing to provide information on whether the remaining hostages set to be freed in the first phase of the deal are alive or dead. Around 90 hostages are still inside Gaza, and Israel believes around a third of them are dead. Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement by not opening the crossing. The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, announced early Monday that an agreement had been reached to release Yehoud along with two other hostages. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the hostage release — which will include female soldier Agam Berger — will take place on Thursday. Another three hostages are expected to be released on Saturday as previously planned. Hamas also handed over a list of information about the hostages to be released in the ceasefire’s six-week first phase. Starting at 7 a.m., Palestinians were allowed to cross on foot without inspection via a coastal road passing through part of the so-called Netzarim corridor , a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles opened later on Gaza's main north-south highwa...",

        "full_content": "By Justin Kabumba, Monika Pronczuk, Wilson Mcmakin, Christina Malkia and Edith M. Lederer / AP Updated: January 27, 2025 3:40 AM EST | Originally published: January 27, 2025 12:40 AM EST GOMA, Congo — Rwanda-backed rebels claimed they captured eastern Congo’s largest city, Goma, early Monday, as the United Nations described a “mass panic” among its 2 million people and Congo’s government said the rebel advance was a “declaration of war.” The M23 rebels announced the city’s capture in a statement minutes before a 48-hour deadline expired that had been imposed by the group for the Congolese army to surrender their weapons. Early Monday morning, gunfire was heard throughout the city, according to two aid workers sheltering there who were not authorized to speak to the media. In a statement, the rebels urged residents of Goma to remain calm and for members of the Congolese military to assemble at the central stadium. The M23 rebels’ offensive in the heart of the mineral-rich region threatens to dramatically worsen one of Africa’s longest wars and further displace civilians. According to a United Nations report, over a third of the population of North Kivu province where Goma is located are currently displaced and the capture of Goma will likely exacerbate the situation. Late Sunday night, U.N. peacekeepers began to process members of the military who had begun to surrender on the outskirts of the city. Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya made a statement in a video posted on X calling for the protection of civilians and saying that the country is “in a war situation where the news is changing.” Late Sunday, the U.N.’s special representative for Congo told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that with the airport shut down and roads blocked in the vast region’s humanitarian and security hub, “we are trapped.” Congo late Saturday broke off relations with Rwanda, which has denied backing the M23 despite evidence collected by U.N. experts and others. The surge of violence has killed at least 13 peacekeepers over the past week. And Congolese were again on the run. The U.N. Security Council condemned the M23 advances in a statement late Sunday and urged the rebels to withdraw from the territory they’d claimed. The M23 has made significant territorial gains along Congo’s border with Rwanda in recent weeks, after months of regional attempts to make peace failed. On Sunday night, the rebels called on Congo’s army to surrender their arms and present themselves at a local stadium by 3 a.m. or they would take the city. The Uruguayan army, who are in Goma serving with the U.N. peacekeeping mission, said in a statement on X late Sunday that some Congolese soldiers have laid down their weapons. “More than a hundred FARDC soldiers are sheltered in the facilities of the “Siempre Presente” base awaiting the (Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration) process,” the statement said. In photos shared with the statement, armed men are seen registering with the peacekeepers in a mix of military uniforms and civilian clothing. The U.N. special representative, Bintou Keita, told the Security Council that despite U.N. peacekeepers’ support for the Congolese armed forces, M23 and Rwandan forces entered the Munigi neighborhood on Goma’s outskirts, “causing mass panic.” Munigi is 9 kilometers (5 miles) from the city. Keita said M23 fighters were advancing and using residents “as human shields” as others fled for their lives. “M23 has declared the airspace over Goma closed,” she added. “In other words, we are trapped.” She said the U.N. was temporarily relocating nonessential personnel from the city. Congo’s foreign minister, Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, told the Security Council that Rwanda was committing “a frontal aggression, a declaration of war which no longer hides itself behind diplomatic maneuvers.” Rwanda’s ambassador to the U.N., Ernest Rwamucyo, did not confirm or deny Congo’s claims. He blamed Congo’s government, saying the crisis could have been been averted if it had “demonstrated a genuine commitment to peace.” The United States and France called for a ceasefire and appealed to Rwanda to withdraw its support to M23, with acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea warning that the U.S. would “consider all the tools at its disposal” to hold accountable those responsible for sustaining the armed conflict. In the past 48 hours, two U.N. peacekeepers from South Africa and one from Uruguay were killed and 11 others were injured and hospitalized, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ spokesman said ahead of the Security Council meeting. The U.N. chief reiterated his “strongest condemnation” of the M23 offensive “with the support of the Rwanda Defense Forces,” and called on the rebel group to immediately halt all hostile action and withdraw, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Congo cuts ties with Rwanda Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis...",

        "full_content": "By Wafaa Shurafa, Samy Magdy, and Joseph Krauss / AP January 26, 2025 9:15 PM EST DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Qatar announced early Monday that an agreement has been reached to release an Israeli civilian hostage and allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, easing the first major crisis of the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The statement from Qatar, a mediator in ceasefire talks, said Hamas will hand over the civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, along with two other hostages before Friday. And on Monday, Israeli authorities will allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement said the hostage release—which will include soldier Agam Berger—will take place on Thursday, and confirmed that Palestinians can move north on Monday. Israel’s military said people can start crossing on foot at 7 a.m. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. But Israel put that on hold because of Yehoud, who Israel said should have been released on Saturday. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement. The release of Yehoud and two others is in addition to the one already set for next Saturday, when three hostages should be released. In addition, Hamas in a statement said the militant group had handed over a list of required information about all hostages to be released in the ceasefire’s six-week first phase. The Israeli prime minister’s office confirmed it had received it. Thousands of Palestinians have gathered, waiting to move north through the Netzarim corridor bisecting Gaza, while local health officials on Sunday said Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two people and wounding nine. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that most of Gaza’s population be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan, to “just clean out” the war-ravaged enclave. Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians rejected that, amid fears that Israel might never allow refugees to return. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said Palestinians would never accept such a proposal, “even if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.” He said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza “even better than before” if Israel lifts its blockade. Dispute and shootings test fragile ceasefire Israeli forces fired on the waiting crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, including a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Israel’s military in a statement said it fired warning shots at “several gatherings of dozens of suspects who were advancing toward the troops and posed a threat to them.” Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza under the ceasefire, which came into effect last Sunday. The military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which still operate in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor. Hamas freed four female Israeli soldiers on Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said Yehoud should have been released ahead of the soldiers. Hamas said it had told mediators—the United States, Egypt and Qatar—that Yehoud was alive and provided guarantees that she would be released. Frustration grew among the Palestinians waiting to go north as some warmed around bonfires against the winter cold. “We have been in agony for a year and a half,” said Nadia Qasem. Fadi al-Sinwar, also displaced from Gaza City, said “the fate of more than a million people is linked to one person,” referring to Yehoud. “See how valuable we are? We are worthless,” he said. Ending the war will be difficult The ceasefire is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half, have died. Itzik Horn, the father of hostages Iair and Eitan Horn, called any resumption of fighting “a death sentence for the hostages” and criticized government ministers who want the war to go on. The ceasefire’s first phase runs until early March and includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second—and far more difficult—phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more, at least three of them mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Seven...",

        "full_content": "By REGINA GARCIA CANO, ZEKE MILLER and ASTRID SUÁREZ / AP Updated: January 27, 2025 12:00 AM EST | Originally published: January 26, 2025 9:00 PM EST BOGOTA, Colombia — The White House claimed victory in a showdown with Colombia over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S. on Sunday, hours after President Donald Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports and other sanctions on the longtime U.S. partner. Long close partners in anti-narcotics efforts, the U.S. and Colombia clashed Sunday over the deportation of migrants and imposed tariffs on each other’s goods in a show of what other countries could face if they intervene in the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. The White House held up the episode as a warning to other nations who might seek to impede his plans. Earlier, the U.S. president had ordered visa restrictions, 25% tariffs on all Colombian incoming goods, which would be raised to 50% in one week, and other retaliatory measures sparked by President Gustavo Petro’s decision to reject two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants after Petro accused Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation. Petro also announced a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump said the measures were necessary because Petro’s decision “jeopardized” national security in the U.S. by blocking the deportation flights. “These measures are just the beginning,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a late Sunday statement that the “Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump’s terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay.” Leavitt said the tariff orders will be “held in reserve, and not signed.” But Leavitt said Trump would maintain visa restrictions on Colombian officials and enhanced customs inspections of goods from the country, “until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned.” The Colombian government late Sunday said it considered as “overcome” the episode with the Trump administration and Petro reposted the statement from the White House on X. “We have overcome the impasse with the United States government,” said Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo. “We will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees, guaranteeing them decent conditions as citizens subject to rights.” Murillo added that the South American country’s presidential aircraft is available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes. Earlier Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was authorizing the visa restrictions on Colombian government officials and their families “who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations.” They were being imposed on top of the State Department’s move to suspend the processing of visas at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia’s capital, Bogota. Petro had said earlier that his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with “dignity.” Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet. “A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,” Petro said. “That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants… In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.” After Trump’s earlier tariff threat, Petro said in a post on X that he had ordered the “foreign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the U.S. by 25%.” Colombia has traditionally been the U.S.’s top ally in Latin America. But their relationship has strained since Petro, a former guerrilla, became Colombia’s first leftist president in 2022 and sought distance from the U.S. Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024. Colombia is also among the countries that last year began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama. The U.S. government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia. “This is a clear message we are sending that countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights,” a senior administrati...",

During a 20-minute question-and-answer session Saturday with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump also said he has ended his predecessor’s hold on sending 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. That lifts a pressure point meant to reduce civilian casualties during Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza , which is now halted by a tenuous ceasefire. “We released them today,\" Trump said of the bombs. “They’ve been waiting for them for a long time.\" Asked why he lifted the ban on those bombs, Trump responded, “Because they bought them.” Trump has built his political career around being unapologetically pro-Israel. On his larger vision for Gaza, Trump said he had call earlier in the day with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt. “I’d like Egypt to take people, and I’d like Jordan to take people,” Trump said. “You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, we just clean out that whole thing.\" Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees and that he told the king, “I’d love for you to take on more, cause I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess. It’s a real mess.” Such a drastic displacement of people would openly contradict Palestinian identity and deep connection to Gaza. Still, Trump said the part of the world that encompasses Gaza, has “had many, many conflicts” over centuries. He said resettling “could be temporary or long term.” “Something has to happen,\" Trump said. “But it’s literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything’s demolished, and people are dying there.” He added: “So, I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement Sunday, thanked Trump for “keeping your promise to give Israel the tools it needs to defend itself.” He did not mention Trump's suggestion on Palestinian refugees. But Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, told reporters that his country’s rejection of the proposed transfer of Palestinians was “firm and unwavering.” Sen. Lindsay Graham, a Trump ally, was asked on CNN's “State of the Union” about what Trump meant with his remark about Palestinians. \"You know, I really don’t know,” said Graham, R-S.C. “The idea that all the Palestinians are going to leave and go somewhere else, I don’t see that to be overly practical,” Graham said. He added, though, that Trump should keep talking to Mideast leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and officials in the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. “I don’t know what he’s talking about. But go talk to MBS, go talk to UAE, go talk to Egypt,” Graham said. “What is their plan for the Palestinians? Do they want them all to leave?” Trump has offered nontraditional views on the future of Gaza in the past. He suggested after he was inaugurated on Monday that Gaza has “really got to be rebuilt in a different way.\" The new president added then, ”Gaza is interesting. It’s a phenomenal location, on the sea. The best weather, you know, everything is good. It’s like, some beautiful things could be done with it, but it’s very interesting.\" Resuming delivery of large bombs, meanwhile, is a break with then-President Joe Biden, who halted their delivery in May as part of an effort to keep Israel from launching an all-out assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. A month later, Israel did take control of the city, but after the vast majority of the 1 million civilians that had been living or sheltering in Rafah had fled. “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,” Biden told CNN in May when he held up the weapons. “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.” The Biden pause had also held up 1,700 500-pound bombs that had been packaged in the same shipment to Israel, but weeks later those bombs were delivered. Trump's action comes as he has celebrated the first phase of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel that has paused the fighting and seen the release of some hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Negotiations have yet to begin in earnest on the more difficult second phase of the deal that would eventually see the release of all hostages held by Hamas and ...",

This is the latest blow to Yoon, who was impeached and arrested over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country into political turmoil, shook its financial markets and hurt its international image.

He will remain jailed and be escorted from a detention facility to a Seoul court for hearings in the trial, which is expected to last about six months. Prosecutors said in a statement that they indicted Yoon on charges that he directed a rebellion when he imposed martial law. Investigative authorities have earlier alleged that Yoon’s imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion, because he staged riots with the purpose of undermining the constitution. Yoon's defense team lashed out at the indictment, calling it “the worst decision” by prosecutors who they say are trying to curry favor with political forces who want Yoon's exit. “Today's indictment of the president will remain as a shame in the history of South Korean prosecutors that they cannot erase,” Yoon's defense team said in a statement. “We stress once again that a president's declaration of martial law can never be rebellion.\" Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege doesn't extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. By law in South Korea, the leader of a rebellion can face a life sentence or capital punishment. Yoon, a conservative, has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, describing his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly, which obstructed his agenda and impeached top officials. During his announcement of martial law, Yoon called the assembly “a den of criminals” and vowed to eliminate “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.” After declaring martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon’s decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it. The martial law imposition, the first of its kind in South Korea in more than four decades, lasted only six hours. However, it evoked painful memories of past dictatorial rules in South Korea in the 1960s-80s when military-backed rulers used martial laws and emergency decrees to suppress opponents. South Korea’s constitution gives the president the power to declare martial law to keep order in wartime and other comparable emergency states, but many experts say the country wasn’t under such conditions when Yoon declared martial law. Yoon insists that he had no intentions of disrupting assembly work, including its floor vote on his decree and that deploying troops and police forces was meant to maintain order. But commanders of military units sent to the assembly have told assembly hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent them from overturning his decree. Investigations on Yoon have intensified the country’s already serious internal division, with rival protesters regularly staging rallies in downtown Seoul. After a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon’s detention, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police said that they detained 46 protesters. Yoon earlier resisted efforts by investigative authorities to question or detain him. He then was apprehended on Jan. 15 in a huge law enforcement operation at his presidential compound. Leading Yoon’s investigation was the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, but Yoon has refused to attend CIO questioning sessions since being detained, saying it has no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations. The CIO has said that it can investigate Yoon’s rebellion allegation because it’s related to his purported abuse of power and other allegations. The CIO handed over Yoon’s case to the Seoul prosecutors’ office on Friday and asked it to indict him on charges of rebellion, abuse of power and obstruction of the National Assembly. Prosecutors said they indicted Yoon only on rebellion, considering that Yoon had presidential immunity from other charges. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and seve...",

Israel later released 200 Palestinian prisoners in the second exchange of a fragile cease-fire . The four Israelis smiled, waved and gave the thumbs-up from a stage in Palestine Square, with armed, masked militants on either side as Hamas sought to show it remained in control in Gaza after 15 months of war. The hostages likely acted under duress. Previously released ones said they were held in brutal conditions and forced to record propaganda videos. Israel's Prison Service said it released 200 Palestinians, including 121 people serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis, while others were held without charge. Thousands of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank city of Ramallah celebrated their arrival. Wan-looking and wearing gray prison sweatsuits, some donned Hamas headbands given to them by the crowd and rode on supporters' shoulders. Read More : A Gaza Cease-Fire Is Here. Why Did It Take So Long? In the deal's first major crisis, Israel said it would not allow displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza by Sunday as anticipated, because civilian hostage Arbel Yehoud was not released as expected. As mediators addressed that, hundreds of Palestinians gathered near the east-west Netzarim corridor dividing Gaza. “Why are they treating us like this?\" asked one man, Khalil Abd. Families huddled around bonfires against the winter cold. Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian man close to the Netzarim corridor, Palestinian medical officials said. Israel’s military said it fired warning shots in response to “gatherings of dozens of suspects.” It said it was unaware of anyone harmed. Israel insists on release of civilian hostage Arbel Yehoud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel would not allow Palestinians into northern Gaza until Yehoud, taken from a kibbutz in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war, was freed. Hamas said it held Israel responsible for “any delay in implementing the agreement and its repercussions.\" A senior Hamas official said the group informed mediators that Yehoud will be released next week. An Egyptian official involved in negotiations called the matter a “minor issue\" that mediators were working to resolve. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The U.S. National Security Council continues to push for Yehoud's release, a spokesperson said. The cease-fire began last weekend with the release of three hostages and 90 prisoners. It is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. The deal has allowed for a surge of aid into tiny, devastated Gaza. Who are the soldiers and prisoners released? The four Israeli soldiers, Karina Ariev, 20, Daniella Gilboa, 20, Naama Levy, 20, and Liri Albag, 19, were taken from Nahal Oz base near the border with Gaza when Palestinian militants overran it, killing more than 60 soldiers. The four squealed as they hurried to embrace loved ones. Thousands of people danced and celebrated as the soldiers arrived by helicopter near a Tel Aviv hospital, which said they were in stable condition. “I had goosebumps watching them,” said Aviv Bercovich in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square. “I just want the war to end.” Thousands of Israelis gathered there again Saturday night to call for all hostages to be freed, amid fears the war will resume. A fifth female soldier in the unit, Agam Berger, 20, also was abducted. “Now she’s there alone,” said family friend Yoni Collins. In Gaza City, resident Radwan Abu Rawiya also watched the handover. “This is huge,” he said. “People forgot about the war, destruction and are celebrating.” Read More : What a Hostage Deal Means for Netanyahu’s Fate A video released by Hamas’ armed wing showed the hostages thanking the militants in Arabic for the “good treatment,” again likely under duress. Israel’s army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari criticized Hamas' “cynical” display. He also said Israel is concerned about the two youngest hostages — Kfir and Ariel Bibas — and their mother, Shiri. Kfir Bibas marked his second birthday in captivity this month. Among the Palestinian prisoners released were Mohammad Odeh, 52, and Wael Qassim, 54, accused of carrying out Hamas attacks against Israelis, including a bombing at a cafeteria at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2002 that killed nine people, including five U.S. citizens. “I am afraid that I will not know him when he gets out, or that he will not know me,” said Rana Raef al-Farra in Gaza, who said she was...",

        "full_content": "Ideas By Amal Murtaja January 24, 2025 3:13 PM EST Murtaja is a sister, a wife, a mom, a teacher, and a writer from Gaza. In her first letter from Gaza, the former blogger Amal Murtaja described daily life in war. A second dispatch closed with the news that she had managed to escape to Egypt with her children. Murtaja, who taught English at Gaza's American International School, wrote this from Giza, outside Cairo . As the potential cease-fire agreement neared, the news was a whirlwind of conflicting reports. It was so nerve-wracking, especially with most of my friends and relatives still in Gaza, that I honestly stopped following closely. I didn't want to get my hopes up. Then, two days ago, my WhatsApp notifications went crazy. I knew something was happening. I turned on the TV and saw the news of the cease-fire. A wave of ambivalence washed over me, and the tears followed immediately. Memories of Eman, my brother's wife, and my nephews, Omar and Zaid, who we lost in October, overwhelmed me. Zaid would have turned 5 this year, and Omar 6. I pictured my burnt house, where I lived so many happy days, and my demolished school, where I built a second family with my colleagues, and the vibrant classrooms now reduced to rubble. I pictured my parents' house, the ultimate source of safety and love. These images of what once was—and now exists only as a memory—flooded my mind. Any joy the ceasefire might bring felt minimized, even overshadowed by these emotions. The past 15 months—though they’ve felt like years—have been incredibly challenging. Adjusting to a new environment and navigating a slightly different culture has been tough, not just for me but for Mohammed and Ali as well. Even now, I often find myself staring out the window, asking, “Where am I?” Egypt is undoubtedly a beautiful place, and the people are warm and loving, and while I’ve grown more familiar with it, it still feels strange to me, like a place I’m living in but not quite a part of yet. I've been trying to settle in, establishing a new routine, learning the streets, and getting to know my neighbors. But this new life, which I'm forcing myself to grow accustomed to, feels nothing like my past life in Gaza. Nothing feels right. I keep comparing everything around me to Gaza. Gaza was a small city with limited resources, yet it was \"enough.\" The people, the family, the friends, the food, the history, the memories—they made it a place of belonging. The small equestrian club where I took Mohammed and Ali every Friday, the smile on my kids’ faces every time they rode a horse was enough. The three-story mall with its little shops and the familiar faces of the shopkeepers was enough. The food court with only 5 restaurants, where I taught Mohammed, at age 7, how to order a meal by himself, that first hesitant \"Excuse me, sir...\" followed by his beaming smile—those moments, those simple joys, were enough. The holy month of Ramadan and the feasts we shared with our family and friends, the table laden with fragrant dishes, the anticipation of breaking our fast together, the laughter and warmth that filled the room—those were enough. The bustling streets during Eid, a symphony of colors and sounds, visiting our relatives and friends, the excitement of my children as they insisted on laying out their new clothes on their beds the night before, eager to wear them at the crack of dawn—these simple pleasures were enough. The parties, my best friends and I threw every now and then, whenever the school stressed us out, to let off some steam and feel less stressed by criticizing the school system together laughing until our sides ached, those were the nights that built the bonds that truly mattered. Now, I can't remember the last time I saw all my friends together, and I rarely see those who have made it to Egypt, we are scattered in the vastness of this country. I miss them all tremendously; they truly are like family to me. Egypt is fascinating, but not “enough.” And voices keep whispering in my ears, \"You don't fit in.\" Life in Egypt hasn’t been kind to us, and we’ve had more than our share of struggles. Not having residency here has created enormous barriers in our attempt to rebuild and move forward. It has hindered us from accessing basic opportunities and what one might call “life.”  After a month-long search, I finally found a school willing to accept Mohammed and Ali without residency. But because we lack proper documentation, they won’t receive end-of-year certificates. While I’m grateful they’re learning, it’s disheartening knowing there’s no official record to show for it. Despite my 12 years of teaching experience, I haven’t been able to find a job here, years of dedication and passion, seem to hold no weight in this country yet. My husband Ramadan hasn’t been able to start a business either. He managed to join us in April, which honestly felt like a miracle. If he had been just one day late crossing the border, he’d still be stuck there. Our son Ali...",

        "full_content": "By SHLOMO MOR and WAAFA SHURAFA / AP January 24, 2025 6:35 AM EST TEL AVIV, Israel— Relatives of hostages still being held by militants in Gaza called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday to ensure all remaining captives are freed, while also appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to continue pressing for their release. As a fragile six-week cease-fire between Israel and Hamas entered its sixth day, Israelis waited anxiously for the names of the next four hostages who will be released from among the more than 90 still held in Gaza. In the Palestinian enclave, civilians in the central and southern part of the Gaza Strip hoping to return to the remnants of their home in the battered north faced an agonizing wait. Israel believes about a third, or possibly as many as half, of the more than 90 hostages still in Gaza have died. Hamas has not released definitive information on how many captives are still alive or the names of those who have died. “Dear President Trump, first of all we want to say thank you for the happy moments we felt this week. But we want to tell you we still have 94 hostages, we need them all at home,” said Ayelet Samerano, whose son Yonatan Samerano is among those still being held. “Please do not stop. Please continue to press and do everything so that all the 94 hostages will come home immediately.” In the first phase of the cease-fire deal, 33 hostages are expected to be released gradually in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The first three Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, the first day of the cease-fire that has halted the 15-month war that has devastated Gaza. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and wide swaths of the territory have been destroyed. According to the deal, on Friday Hamas is to announce the names of the next four hostages to be released on Saturday, after which Israel will also release a list of which Palestinian prisoners will be freed. The hostages were among about 250 men, women and children captured by militants who burst across the border into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people in an attack that sparked the war in Gaza. About 100 were released during a brief cease-fire in November that year, while the bodies of around three dozen hostages have been recovered in Gaza and eight hostages have been rescued by the army. “I call from here to the Prime Minister and negotiating team -- you’re doing excellent work -- do whatever is necessary to bring everyone back, to the last hostage,” Samerano said. “We ask you to ensure phase two of the deal is agreed upon before finishing the current phrase. We cannot continue living in uncertainty. All hostages must return, and none of them has time left.” The 33 to be released in the first phase will include women, children, sick people and those over 50 — almost all civilians, though the deal also commits Hamas to freeing all living female soldiers in Phase 1. Hamas will release living hostages first, but could release some bodies if they don’t have enough living hostages in this category. Male soldiers are not expected to be released in the first phase. “This week we were moved to watch images of mothers embracing their daughters, but our hearts break thinking that my son Nimrod and other men remain behind, and each day they’re there poses a real danger to their lives,” said Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod Cohen is among the hostages. “The worry that the deal won’t be fully implemented gnaws at us all. All senior officials openly say that stopping the deal means a death sentence for those left behind.” Under the terms of the deal, Palestinians in Gaza will have more freedom of movement from the north to the south of the enclave. Civilians in the south will be allowed to take a coastal road to northern Gaza from Saturday, when Israeli troops are expected to withdraw from the key route and Hamas is set to release the next four Israeli hostages. Those in other parts of the strip seized on the cease-fire this week to reunite with scattered family members, picking their way through vast swaths of rubble and trying to salvage what remained of their homes and their belongings. But those displaced from the north have had to wait. “The first thing I’ll do, I’ll kiss the dirt of the land on which I was born and raised,” said Nadia Al-Debs, one of the many people gathered in makeshift tents in Gaza’s central city of Deir al-Balah preparing to set out for home in Gaza City the next day. “We’ll return so my children can see their father.” Nafouz al-Rabai, another displaced woman in Deir al-Balah from al-Shati, along the coast in Gaza City, said the day she walks home will be a “day of joy for us.” The return stirs bittersweet emotions. Al-Rabai acknowledged it would be painful to absorb the scale of damage to the home and the urban refugee camp she knew and loved. “God knows if I’ll find (my house) standing or not,” she said...",

        "full_content": "By YURAS KARMANAU / AP January 24, 2025 2:30 AM EST T he last time Belarus staged a presidential election in 2020, authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner with 80% of the vote. That triggered cries of fraud, months of protests and a harsh crackdown with thousands of arrests. Not wanting to risk such unrest again by those opposing his three decades of iron-fisted rule, Lukashenko advanced the timing of the 2025 election—from the warmth of August to frigid January, when demonstrators are less likely to fill the streets. With many of his political opponents either jailed or exiled abroad, the 70-year-old Lukashenko is back on the ballot, and when the election concludes on Sunday, he is all but certain to add a seventh term as the only leader most people in post-Soviet Belarus have ever known. Here’s what to know about Belarus, its election and its relationship with Russia: ‘Europe’s last dictator’ and his reliance on Russia Belarus was part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. The Slavic nation of 9 million people is sandwiched between Russia and Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, the latter three all NATO members. It was overrun by Nazi Germany in World War II. It’s been closely allied with Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin—himself in power for a quarter century. Lukashenko, a former state farm director, was first elected in 1994, riding public anger over a catastrophic plunge in living standards after chaotic and painful free-market reforms. He promised to combat corruption. Throughout his rule, he’s relied on subsidies and political support from Russia, allowing it to use Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine in 2022 and later agreeing to host some of Russia’s tactical nuclear weapons. Lukashenko was dubbed “ Europe’s last dictator ” early in his tenure, and he has lived up to that nickname, harshly silencing dissent and extending his rule through elections that the West has called neither free nor fair. An open admirer of the Soviet Union, he has restored Soviet-style controls on the economy, discouraged use of the Belarusian language in favor of Russian, and pushed for abandoning the country’s red-and-white national flag in favor of one similar to what it used as a Soviet republic. Belarus’ top security agency kept its fearsome Soviet-era name of the KGB, and it’s the only country in Europe to keep the death penalty, with executions carried out with a gunshot to the back of the head. Flirtation with the West, repression at home As he bargained with the Kremlin over the years for more subsidies, Lukashenko periodically tried to appease the West by easing repressions. Such flirtations ended after he unleashed a violent suppression of dissent after the 2020 election. That election to his sixth term was widely seen at home and abroad as rigged, and it sparked months of massive protests, the largest ever seen in Belarus. Authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown in which over 65,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten by police and hundreds of independent media outlets and nongovernmental organizations were closed and outlawed, drawing Western sanctions. Leading opposition figures have either been imprisoned or fled the country. Human rights activists say Belarus holds about 1,300 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, the founder of the country’s top rights group, Viasna. Lukashenko’s maneuvers before the election Although Lukashenko’s current term doesn’t expire until summer, the election was moved up in what officials said would allow him “to exercise his powers at the initial stage of strategic planning.” Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich gave a different reason, saying “There won’t be mass protests in freezing January,” he said. In other maneuvering, Lukashenko has pardoned 250 people described as political prisoners by rights activists. The pardons, however, come amid heightened repressions aimed at uprooting any remaining signs of dissent. Hundreds have been arrested in raids that targeted relatives and friends of political prisoners. Other arrests include participants in online chats organized by residents of apartment buildings in various cities. Unlike the 2020 election, Lukashenko faces only token challengers, with other opposition candidates rejected for the ballot by the Central Election Commission. The election began with early voting Tuesday and concludes Sunday. “The politicians who once dared to challenge Lukashenko are now literally rotting in prison in torture conditions, there has been no contact with them for over a year, and some of them are in very poor health,” said Viasna representative Pavel Sapelka. Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who challenged Lukashenko in the 2020 election and was forced to flee the country afterward, says the latest vote is a farce and urged Belarusians to vote against every candidate. Her husband, activist Siarhei Tsikhanouski...",

Print It is no secret why President Trump forced out FBI Director Christopher Wray, his first-term pick to be the nation’s chief law enforcement officer: Soon after the Jan. 6 insurrection, Wray told Congress that the Capitol siege was an act of “domestic terrorism.” And for the next four years, he oversaw the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history to bring the perpetrators to justice — including their instigator and cheerleader, Trump. Even before Jan. 6, Wray repeatedly warned Congress that the problem of “domestic violent extremists” — DVEs, in bureau parlance — rivals or exceeds that of international terrorism. The threat “has been metastasizing across the country,” Wray testified in 2021, and “it’s not going away anytime soon.” Opinion Columnist Jackie Calmes Jackie Calmes brings a critical eye to the national political scene. She has decades of experience covering the White House and Congress. Read more from Jackie Calmes Trump, by his Day 1 blanket clemency for the Jan. 6 “DVEs,” has helped make sure of that. We’re all less safe as a consequence. Advertisement The president will have an ally in excusing right-wing extremism if the Republican-run Senate confirms the president’s choice to succeed Wray: provocateur Kash Patel, spreader of anti-FBI conspiracy theories and apologist for the Jan. 6 rioters. Patel’s confirmation hearing is set for Thursday. For weeks Trump’s Republican allies have argued that his picks for national security posts in his Cabinet — Patel as well as Pete Hegseth, confirmed Friday for Pentagon chief, and Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence — should have been hustled to confirmation in the wake of the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans and a suicide truck explosion outside a Trump hotel in Las Vegas . Here’s the irony of that argument: Those reminders of the ongoing threat of domestic extremism only underscore why all three Cabinet picks are unfit to be security stewards. They not only lack experience for the jobs Trump wants to entrust them with, they have a record of undermining the essential institutions they would head. Advertisement Patel has warred against the FBI for years. Hegseth, aside from his history of alleged sexual assault, falling-down drunkenness and mismanagement, defended accused and convicted war criminals as a Fox News talking head and helped persuade Trump, in his first term, to grant them clemency. Gabbard, who would be in charge of all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies, has opposed their past findings about Russia’s Vladimir Putin and since-deposed Syrian strongman Bashar Assad, echoing those murderous dictators’ talking points instead. But all three Cabinet choices have the one qualification Trump cares about: loyalty to him. That alone makes Patel, especially, a danger to America’s security. His zeal for attacking Trump ’ s political enemies would follow him into the FBI director’s office. Among those targets are former President Biden; former Biden, Obama and even Trump administration officials; prosecutors involved in the federal cases against Trump, now dropped, for trying to overturn his 2020 election loss and for making off with top secrets, and the witnesses in those cases. Advertisement Of course, Trump’s enemies aren’t America’s enemies. They’re not the ones whom Wray as well as numerous other security experts have warned about. Trump and Patel’s fixation on retribution would necessarily distract the bureau from the real threats, domestic and foreign, that endanger the nation. And now Trump has exacerbated the danger by setting hundreds of Jan. 6 extremists free. The now-pardoned QAnon Shaman, Jacob Chansley, quickly exulted on X, in all capital letters, that he was “gonna buy some [expletive] guns!!!” Fortunately, Daniel Ball, jailed but not tried yet for allegedly assaulting officers and using an explosive on Jan. 6, wasn’t released despite the pardon because of a separate federal gun charge : He has been indicted on a charge of possessing a firearm despite past felony convictions (domestic battery by strangulation and resisting police with violence). Nice guy — and not alone among those pardoned and set free in having a criminal record. The immediate threat, of course, is less to the American public than to the freed attackers’ families, friends and associates whom they blame for their legal travails. Jackson Reffitt, who turned in his father, Guy Reffitt, after Jan. 6 and testified during his dad’s trial that Guy threatened to kill him and his sister if they did so, has moved and purchased two guns for protection. “I can’t imagine being safe right now,” the son lamented to MSNBC. “It ...",

Print Presidential pardons began with the George Washington, who pardoned those who participated in the violence known as the Whiskey Rebellion. Long before Jack Sparrow, there was the Caribbean pirate Jean Lafitte, and he got a presidential pardon. New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was pardoned by Ronald Reagan. All it took was a few strokes of the pen for Donald Trump and Joe Biden to add to a long, strange American tradition. The presidential pardon dates back to George Washington more than two centuries ago. Bestowed upon thousands and thousands of Americans since then, it remains a power both unique and highly subjective. Richard Nixon says goodbye with a victorious salute to his staff members outside the White House as he boards a helicopter after resigning the presidency on Aug. 9, 1974. President Gerald Ford fully pardoned Nixon one month later. (Bob Daugherty / Associated Press) “Generally, presidents may pardon any federal crime,” says Jeffrey Crouch, an assistant law professor at American University in Washington, D.C. “Moreover, they may use clemency as often as they would like.” This authority has led to controversial decisions, including reprieves for the likes of President Richard Nixon, officials implicated in the Iran-Contra affair and disgraced commodities trader Marc Rich. The list grew a little longer in recent weeks when Trump pardoned 1,500 or so Jan. 6 rioters and Biden did likewise for some of his closest family members . The history of executive clemency is also marked by examples that have slipped from memory despite being just as debatable or, in some cases, quirky. Advertisement Here is a sampling: 1795: The Whiskey Rebellion In the early 1790s, Pennsylvania farmers tarred and feathered several government officials sent to collect a new tax on whiskey production. As violence spread, Washington — in his second term as president — personally led a militia force to quell what became known as the Whiskey Rebellion. Washington decided to issue the first executive clemency in 1795, exonerating “all persons guilty of the said treasons.”  Though insistent on the rule of law, he spoke of a need to “mingle in the operations of government every degree of moderation and tenderness.” 1815: The pirate Jean Lafitte During the War of 1812, British forces approached the notorious Gulf of Mexico smuggler for help in attacking the U.S. coastline. Lafitte not only warned American authorities; he and his crew proved crucial in defending New Orleans. Advertisement As a reward, President James Madison pardoned them for any “clandestine and lawless” acts they might previously have committed. Politics Jan. 6 rioters freed by Trump include Californians and those who assaulted officers Rioters who were convicted and imprisoned for their roles in the violent attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 were being released after receiving pardons and commutations from Trump. Jan. 21, 2025 1830: George Wilson This case showed that not all pardons are created equal. President Andrew Jackson issued an executive clemency that spared Wilson from being hanged for robbing the mail, but did not preclude a lengthy prison term. Wilson turned it down.

Print Becerra says he’s mulling options now that his time in the Biden Cabinet is over. Some allies say he’s strongly considering a run for California governor. The main challenge he faced leading the Department of Health and Human Services, Becerra said, was “COVID. COVID. COVID. There was nothing else.” His potential successor to lead HHS is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who questions the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. WASHINGTON — He’s served in the California Legislature, in Congress and, most recently, in the Cabinet as President Biden’s secretary of Health and Human Services. And don’t forget his time as California’s attorney general, a post also once held by Vice President Kamala Harris and a springboard for higher office . So what’s next for Xavier Becerra? According to Becerra allies, who requested anonymity to discuss his plans candidly, he is “strongly considering” running for governor and is already exploring the possibility with members of the state’s congressional delegation, donor class and potential supporters. Advertisement California Will Kamala Harris run for California governor in 2026? The question is already swirling If Vice President Kamala Harris decides to run for California governor, she would seismically reshape the race and cause ripple effects on down-ballot contests. Dec. 10, 2024 Becerra  last week demurred when asked about his plans days after leaving his federal post. “I’m in the process of transitioning back to California,” he said. “I have lots to think about, including seeing more of my family.“ In an earlier interview held in the formal conference room outside his HHS office, Becerra reflected on his tenure in the Biden administration leading a team of 95,000. It was just three days before President Trump’s inauguration, as staffers took down nameplates from nearby doors. “Looking back, it’s been a momentous four years,” the 66-year-old Becerra said. “I think most people would tell you that we have delivered on mission. We were very focused. We took over at a time of very difficult circumstances. We climbed our way out.” Advertisement Asked what his first priorities were when he took the oath of office in March 2021, Becerra replied, “COVID. COVID. COVID. There was nothing else.” Among the administration’s top accomplishments, he said, was getting 700 million COVID vaccination shots into the arms of Americans, and people could get their shots just about anywhere — from large-scale distribution centers to barbershops to pharmacies. “We realized we had to get to where people were,” he said. He also cited providing more than 300 million people access to healthcare, with 46 million Americans getting health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. He also touted the launch of the 988 hotline that provides round-the-clock suicide and crisis counseling. Advertisement “We’ve never had an administration be this direct and determined on mental health — to the point where the resources can’t be matched,” Becerra said. “It’s historically the largest investment in mental health.” Asked whether he was concerned about the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Senate and House rolling back these gains , he said his agency had worked to protect them.

He also said he was optimistic now that Americans are more familiar with the protections they received under the Affordable Care Act, such as coverage for preexisting conditions, which will make it politically more difficult for Republicans to accomplish policy goals such as repealing Obamacare. “Too many people know now. Before, they weren’t familiar with it. Today, they know what they’ve got,” Becerra said. “You could be complacent. You don’t have to worry because right now you’ve got your care.

Print WASHINGTON — Facing another early challenge to his  immigration policies, President Trump on Sunday ordered a 25% tariff on exports from Colombia and a travel ban on Colombian officials and “their supporters” as punishment for the country’s refusal to accept military deportation flights from the U.S. “These measures are just the beginning,” Trump declared on social media. Colombia’s action came as numerous countries in Latin America are attempting to figure out how to deal with the week-old Trump administration, pledging cooperation on some immigration issues but also seeking fair treatment and respect for their own national sovereignty. Media reports in the U.S. quoted Pentagon officials as saying Mexico also denied landing permission to a deportation flight late last week. While Mexico did not explicitly confirm or deny the action, its Foreign Ministry emphasized its spirit of continued cooperation with the U.S. President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would address the matter Monday. Advertisement World & Nation Stranded in Mexico City, these migrants hoping to reach the United States have no good options The 1,500 migrants living in this Mexico City encampment face hard choices with President Trump in office. Jan. 26, 2025 Nevertheless, tensions are high in Mexico, the country that is the largest source of U.S.-bound migrants and where tens of thousands are becoming stranded as Trump ends amnesty and other legal-entry programs. Both Colombia and Mexico in the past accepted some deportation flights but may be reacting now to Trump’s threats to increase the number exponentially and include more third-country migrants. Some in the region are also unnerved by the switch from civilian aircraft to U.S. military planes in the deportations. Trump said he would raise the tariffs on all Colombian goods coming to the U.S. to 50% after one week if flights are not allowed. While Colombia is not high on the list of the region’s traders with the U.S., exporting only about $16 billion in goods, coffee is among its top commodities.   It also exports roses and other fresh-cut flowers, used widely in the U.S. on holidays like Valentines Day. Advertisement He also said he was revoking U.S. visas from various members of the Colombian government, putting  visa restrictions on tens of thousands of other Colombians, enhancing customs and border inspections on people and cargo from Colombia and imposing a raft of unspecified financial and banking sanctions. World & Nation What will Mexico do if Trump tries to mass deport non-Mexicans across the border? How will Mexican leaders respond if, as expected, Trump pressures them to accept deportees from third countries? ‘Mexico is in a really tough spot.’ Jan. 16, 2025 Trump’s wrath came in response to actions by Gustavo Petro, the left-leaning president of Colombia, who is dealing with his own immigration crisis: the arrival of massive numbers of people fleeing neighbor Venezuela. “I was just informed that two repatriation flights from the United States, with a large number of Illegal Criminals, were not allowed to land in Colombia,” Trump wrote. “We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!” Advertisement The two military C-17 aircraft departed San Diego with about 80 migrants  and headed for Colombia before being turned around, officials said. With Trump’s return to office, Petro made a brief attempt at avoiding confrontation, but that seems to have vanished. Also writing on social media, Petro earlier Sunday did not rule out allowing the repatriation of Colombian nationals but said the process had to be “dignified.” “The U.S. cannot treat Colombian migrants like criminals,” Petro wrote. “I am denying the entry of United States airplanes with Colombian migrants to our territory. The U.S. must establish a protocol for the dignified treatment of migrants before we receive them.” He later said he would offer his presidential plane to pick up Colombian deportees to avoid them being left stranded and stateless. He also said he would play a tit-for-tat with Trump, suggesting he would impose a 25% tariff on U.S. exports. World & Nation Mexico cracks down on drugs and migrants.

Print Going back a generation, the tech industry’s involvement in politics was fleeting and peripheral. Midas-size fortunes and freedom to spend as much as they’d like have turned tech barons in kingmakers When the high and mighty of Silicon Valley assumed their privileged perch at the swearing-in of President Trump , it was an ostentatious show of wealth and power unlike any before. “You could go back to the Gilded Age and you could have a similar concentration of capital and power. You know, Rockefeller and Carnegie,” said historian Margaret O’Mara, citing two of the richest men who ever bestrode the earth. “But they weren’t on the dais of the inauguration.” The moment was open to varied interpretation. Was it Trump, that most status-conscious of alpha males, bringing to heel the formidable likes of Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg? Or were all those billionaire potentates in the Capitol Rotunda — seated in front of Trump’s Cabinet picks — asserting their social, economic and cultural hegemony? Advertisement Maybe both. Regardless, there is no denying the remarkable ascendance of Silicon Valley and its tech leaders, in a single generation, from a collection of indifferent and often politically naive entrepreneurs into king-making, proximate-to-power lords of the political universe. Only in America. And, yes, that’s sarcasm you detect. Politics Side-by-side, two friends watch Trump’s inauguration from their partisan corners President Donald Trump was sworn in Monday morning among a group of dignitaries and guests inside the Capitol. Jan. 20, 2025 The explanation for their propinquity lies not in the creation of some whiz-bang, life-changing, paradigm-bending consumer product, or the shining virtues or particularly fertile minds that grace Silicon Valley’s fruited plain. “It’s one of the oldest truisms in politics,” said Larry Gerston, a San José State political science professor emeritus, who’s followed the tech industry from a front-row seat for decades. “ Money buys access .” Advertisement Bezos’ Amazon and Zuckerberg’s Meta were among the tech firms that tithed $1 million each to help pay for Trump’s inauguration. Musk invested more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump . Given his conjoined-twin closeness to the 47th president, it appears money well spent. Let’s travel back to another lifetime, July 1997, when, with great fanfare, some of Silicon Valley’s top entrepreneurs and executives announced formation of a venture dubbed the Technology Network. Based in Palo Alto, it was founded as a one-stop shop to promote political causes, lobby on issues, and support preferred candidates. Creation of the organization and its seeding with $2 million in pocket change was a notable departure for the industry which, up to then, had only fleetingly and peripherally been involved in campaigns and elections. As Gerston put it at the time, “These guys don’t know from politics. Their mentality has always been to take every dime they had and put it into research and development, and then product.” Advertisement That head-down insularity began to change with the realization that issues such as taxes, tariffs, foreign trade and legal liability mattered a great deal to high-tech’s prosperity and long-term future. Industry leaders grew more involved in regional affairs, focusing on subjects such as permitting and transportation. On the state level, they spent tens of millions to defeat a 1996 California ballot measure that would have facilitated the filing of security-fraud lawsuits. (High-tech companies were a particular target of such shareholder suits because of the volatility of their stocks .)

Dec. 13, 2024 In Washington, President Clinton and his techie vice president, Al Gore, broke ground by assiduously courting the industry, eager to associate themselves with its perceived coolness and cutting-edge cachet.

One upshot was Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which to this day insulates social media from legal liability for the content — however incendiary or scurrilous — that users post.

Print As part of a broader rollout of executive orders, President Trump called for an end to government censorship, including on social media. Critics said they found the order absurd given Trump’s long record attacking speech and other actions aimed at curtailing the speech of journalists, government experts, LGBTQ+ people and others. In one of his first acts in office, President Trump issued an executive order promising to end government censorship and restore free speech. The order accused the outgoing Biden administration of harassing social media companies and violating the rights of average Americans “under the guise” of combating disinformation online, and said federal resources would no longer be used to “unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.” The order echoed a recurring theme from Trump’s campaign — that liberals across the federal government are censoring conservative voices to advance their own “woke” agenda — and immediately resonated with his followers. Advertisement “This order is a critical step to ensure the government cannot dictate what speech is permissible or weaponize private entities to enforce censorship,” said Mark Trammell of the Center for American Liberty, a conservative rights group founded by California attorney Harmeet K. Dhillon, Trump’s nominee to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. However, many others said they found Trump’s order absurd — both because of his long track record of attacking speech he doesn’t like, and because of his new administration’s simultaneous efforts to muzzle people it disagrees with, including journalists, federal health officials, teachers, diplomats , climate scientists and the LGBTQ+ community . “Let’s not be naive,” said Hadar Harris, the Washington managing director of PEN America, which has advocated for free speech in the U.S. for more than a century. “While some of President Trump’s flurry of executive orders pay lip service to free speech, in reality they frame a frontal assault against it, dictating the terms of allowable expression and identities, demanding political loyalty from civil servants, and threatening retaliation against dissent in ways that could cast a broad chill on free expression well beyond the halls of government.” Advertisement California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said Trump’s claiming to be a free speech champion while attacking the media and harshly restricting how longtime civil servants can communicate with the public — including in critical areas such as public health — was “ironic and hypocritical.” “It’s classic Trump administration,” Bonta said. “It’s their rhetoric versus their actions, and you have to look at their actions.” Limiting communication Both at home and abroad, the Trump administration has ordered federal employees and diplomats to cease communications on a range of issues, including “diversity, equity and inclusion,” “environmental justice” and “gender ideology.” Advertisement It ordered Department of Defense officials to stop posting information on official social media accounts unless it is about the southern border, and health and other federal experts to limit communications even on critical public safety issues such as the spread of bird flu — which California officials have declared an emergency. Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a public health professor and infectious-disease expert at USC, said he was alarmed Thursday when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention withdrew from a planned bird flu discussion with the Infectious Disease Society of America. Klausner said their pulling out was “a big loss for our ability to understand what’s going on” nationally. Klausner said past administrations have given health leaders new orders — to curtail spending, shift priorities — but never such directives to halt so many critical communications at once. He called it “extremely concerning.” Trump also has ordered a sweeping crackdown on federal communications about the LGBTQ+ community — removing LGBTQ+ resource materials from government websites and placing new restrictions on how federal employees can discuss or speak to LGBTQ+ people — or even use words such as “sex” or “gender.” He has threatened similar restrictions on public school teachers and administrators, and ordered that LGBTQ+ Americans may no longer identify as transgender on passports and other documents.

Print Trump’s plans to overhaul immigration could drain caregivers from the workforce as California and the country prepare for an aging population, advocates say. Foreign-born workers make up a significant percentage of the workforce in long-term care, especially among home health workers. Only a small percentage of caregivers in nursing homes and home healthcare are believed to be undocumented, but some fear that an immigration crackdown could have a broader chilling effect and discourage new immigrant workers from entering the industry. President Trump’s plans to overhaul immigration could reduce the ranks of workers who care for elderly and disabled people at home and in long-term care facilities as California and the country grapple with the needs of an aging population, healthcare experts and immigrant advocates say. Trump has pledged to carry out the biggest deportation effort in U.S. history. On his first day in office he signed executive orders to suspend refugee admissions for months, require asylum seekers to stay in Mexico as their cases were adjudicated, and roll back humanitarian programs that had granted temporary legal status and work authorization to more than 1.5 million people. That could have consequences for tens of millions of older Americans who may end up requiring long-term care. California estimates that by 2030, a quarter of the state’s population will be at least 60 years old. Across the U.S., the demand for home health aides, nursing assistants and personal care aides in long-term care has been projected to rise between 35% and 41% from 2022 to 2037, according to the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis . Advertisement “Long-term care providers and nursing homes in particular have really struggled, for decades, to recruit staff,” said David C. Grabowski, professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. “The jobs are challenging. They typically aren’t well-paid.” The problem was only magnified with the strain of the pandemic, he said. Now, “at a time where it seems fewer and fewer of us want to work in long-term care, the need has never been greater.” Immigrants make up 28% of the workers who care directly for people in nursing homes and other forms of long-term care, according to a national analysis by the independent research group KFF. In California nursing homes, more than half of certified nursing assistants — direct care workers who feed, bathe and dress residents — were born in other countries, according to a study published last year in Health Affairs. Advertisement A smaller percentage are believed to be in the country without legal authorization: The American Immigration Council, a left-leaning nonprofit that advocates for immigrants, estimates that 4.2% of nursing assistants and 6.4% of home health aides nationally are undocumented, based on its analysis of Census Bureau data. Those numbers may seem modest, but in the face of the demand for such workers, “when you remove that percentage of the workforce, it becomes a huge problem,” said Steven Hubbard, a senior data scientist at the American Immigration Council. Although Americans are more widely in support of deporting people convicted of violent crimes, a significant share of adults surveyed — 43% — support deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, according to a recent poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Advertisement California Assemblymember Carl DeMaio (R-San Diego) rejected the idea that the changes in immigration policy anticipated under the Trump administration would harm the caregiving sector, saying that “a secure border is not mutually exclusive with a vibrant workforce.” “People who want an open border are trying to demonize or distort the public policy discussion here by cherry-picking one element and not seeing the full spectrum of savings that we would achieve,” DeMaio said. Groups that want to reduce immigration have also argued that restricting the flow of immigrants would put upward pressure on wages , benefiting American workers who might then take caregiving jobs. Others questioned that idea: Wages for such care have remained low despite existing shortages of caregivers, which were worsened by an exodus of employees amid the COVID-19 emergency, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy manager with KFF’s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured. If wages haven’t surged so far, “it’s hard to imagine why that would be true if we continue to cut down on the available long-term care workforce.” Caregivers could also be affected by rollbacks to Temporary Protected Status ...",

They urge me to bow down to the president and accept his victory as a mandate against all they despise about the progressive left: its insistence that centuries of racial and gender discrimination will not magically disappear without intervention, that women should be able to control their own bodies, that all Americans should have health insurance, that the very rich should pay their fair share of taxes and that we are — proudly — a nation of immigrants. They want me to pretend that we have an alien invasion at the southern border and that deporting those who are here illegally will somehow make everyone else’s lives better rather than impose a reign of terror and raise the cost of goods and services.

And at least half the country, including most of California, feels the same way. “There is no mandate,” UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck said Thursday during a Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior seminar on “Hate and Politics.” (The institute’s “Open Mind” program offers free, remotely accessible hourlong seminars that explore a wide range of mental health issues with experts in various fields.) Advertisement Opinion Column: Donald Trump is president again. Did you feel the vibe shift? Did Trump or trends shatter our bedrock assumptions? Either way, the usual thinking about how politics “works” and the rules for what a politician can or can’t do, no longer seem operative Jan. 20, 2025 The last few presidential elections, Vavreck said, have demonstrated that the electorate is “calcified,” with “rough parity” between the numbers of Democrats and Republicans. This means that a relatively small number of voters who identify with neither party have become pivotal. “The ‘out’ party seems like an attractive option” to these voters, who are unhappy about the state of the country, Vavreck said. Thus, Joe Biden likely won in 2020 largely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Trump likely won in 2024 mainly because of inflation. In any case, Vavreck repeated: “There is no mandate.” My political views and deepest ideals do not change because a slim plurality of American voters elected a man who is trying to orchestrate a return to a time when rich white men ruled the world, when there were only two acceptable genders , when gay people could not marry, when women could not serve in combat and when the United States could behave as if the rest of the world did not really exist. My parents — one religiously devout and the other an atheist — taught me better than that. Advertisement I’m never going to stop criticizing the cruel, inane policies of a president who cannot bear being publicly admonished — by a woman of God — to be merciful to the powerless without descending into a tantrum more suited to a toddler than a 78-year-old man. Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde’s plea to Trump during a prayer service at Washington National Cathedral on Tuesday brought to mind his criminal “hush money” trial in New York last spring, when he was forced to remain silent as witnesses testified against him and a jury convicted him of 34 felony counts. He wore the same disgusted face on both occasions. Trump is rarely a captive audience; Budde courageously seized the opportunity to  demonstrate what true spiritual leadership looks like. “I wasn’t demanding anything of him,” Budde later told the New York Times . “I was pleading with him, like, can you see the humanity of these people?...",

Print Earlier this month, a full moon blocked Mars from view. Historically, some have taken that as a sign for peace as Mars has been the “planet of war and conflict in many cultures, from ancient China to ancient Rome,” according to science writer Rebecca Boyle. At least then there may be celestial hope for President Trump’s nearly two-year-old promise to end the war in Ukraine. “I’ll have that done in 24 hours,” he told a CNN town hall in May 2023. He doubled down during a presidential debate in September 2024: “I will get it settled before I even become president.” But then the bravado behind those boastful campaign pledges lost steam this month. Trump’s nominee as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, pushed the goalpost for peace back “100 days” in an interview , from Inauguration Day’s Jan. 20 to early May. Opinion Opinion: Will Trump strike a deal letting Russia partition Ukraine? The president-elect’s vow to stop the war may lead to concessions to Putin, including divisions of territory, which have a bloody history. Dec. 3, 2024 Whatever deadline you set, ending the war in Ukraine is the first test of the Trump administration. Unfortunately the new president is learning that there’s no such thing as a drive-by peace deal. Whatever hope the solar system may offer, all real wars come down to hard ground truths. Advertisement The hard ground truth in Ukraine is that, as Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower once put it, “sometimes it just gets down to the dirty job of killing until one side or the other cracks.” Right now the Russians are far closer to cracking than the Ukrainians are. While the Russians can absorb more pain, they do not want to take more; the Ukrainians have more limited resources, yet are willing to take more pain because they’re fighting for their country. Opinion Granderson: Aiding Ukraine has been cheap. Caving to Russia would be far more costly If the incoming administration abandons Kyiv, Russia’s ambitions will explode and nuclear weapons will proliferate. Nov. 22, 2024 Russia currently holds 18% of Ukraine’s sovereign territory (terrain the size of Ohio). Ukraine has retaken 54% of what the Russians held at one point. The fighting over three years has cost Ukraine more than 400,000 dead and injured. Russia’s toll is more than 700,000 dead and injured . This cost is high yet sustainable on both sides. The Ukrainians have absorbed approximately 11,000 total casualties per month. The Russians, roughly 20,000 total casualties a month. The strategist Edward Luttwak has estimated , “the number of male Ukrainians that annually reach military age is at least 235,000 or 20,000 per month”; but “every month more than 100,000 Russian males reach military age.” So this war is grinding up more than half of Ukraine’s young men, and one-fifth of Russia’s (setting aside women’s considerable contribution to the war effort, particularly for Ukraine). Advertisement Opinion Opinion: How Ukraine can press its advantage after seizing Russian territory Kyiv’s push north is precisely the kind of action that stands the best chance of discouraging Vladimir Putin and eventually bringing this war to an end. Aug. 21, 2024 But that’s what war does. It trades lives for objectives. It is painful and it is awful and it is crude, but this is also the grim arithmetic by which big wars are won. Such math is taught to every Ukrainian basic trainee, that everyone “on frontline duty must take the life of at least one Russian soldier, preferably more, before dying himself,” as recently reported . While that remarkable rate doesn’t guarantee victory, over time it can have a devastating impact. That’s why most wars are won by outlasting the other side, as the historian Cathal Nolan has pointed out . The Russians have admitted they’re being outlasted. Last fall, they recruited North Korean troops into their ranks, alongside the convicts, mercenaries and poor kids from Siberia who make up the rest of its remaining army. Death payments alone cost the Russian government $30 billion over a recent one-year period. About 40% of Russia’s national budget now goes to the military. Advertisement Morale is with Ukraine. Their units wear patches that read “Ukraine or Death.” Their generals pronounce : “We’ll fight the Russians to the death, until the last Ukrainian.” Their soldiers, unarmed and about to be executed, smoke cigarettes and shout : “Glory to Ukraine.” And they know they’re fighting for their children against an adversary that has stolen well over 19,000 Ukrainian kids since the war began. So how could the U.S. persuade Ukraine to end the war now? W...",

Print A sense of despair has engulfed the migrant camp of La Soledad, named after the colonial-era church that towers over the shantytown in downtown Mexico City. It was supposed to be a temporary stop, a place to regroup and wait for the right moment to continue on toward the United States. Then President Trump issued decrees that effectively shut down migration along the U.S.-Mexico border, leaving tens of thousands of migrants marooned in camps, shelters and other accommodations across Mexico, from the southern hinterlands to the Rio Grande. World & Nation Disappointment at border as Trump cancels immigration program The Trump administration cancelled a program aimed at easing the process of applying for asylum, leaving thousands of asylum-seekers disappointed and unsure of what to do next. Jan. 20, 2025 Despondent and broke — many sold homes, borrowed cash, paid smugglers and left children behind in pursuit of the American dream — they now face an existential reckoning : What next? Advertisement “There’s great uncertainty right now,” said Manuela Pérez Jerónimo, a 47-year-old from Guatemala who was roasting potatoes over charcoal. “No one knows anything. Will we be able to cross the border? Will we all get deported?” The Times spoke to some of the 1,500 or so denizens of La Soledad as they weighed their three main options: turn back, wait and see, or push on. World & Nation Mexico’s president reacts to Trump moves on immigration, border and cartels. ‘It’s nothing new’ Mexico’s President Sheinbaum says she will work with Trump on deportations, border issues and cartels, but laughs at his ‘Gulf of America’ order. Jan. 21, 2025 Giving up the dream There is no census, and migrants come and go, but the majority of people in La Soledad appear to be from Venezuela , the once-wealthy South American nation that has seen an exodus of more than 7 million amid an economic, social and political crackup. Jormaris Figuera Fernández, 42, and her husband, Jesus Manuel Marquez Murillo, 31, both from Venezuela, at their shanty in La Soledad migrant camp in downtown Mexico City. (Cecilia Sánchez Vidal / For The Times) “It became impossible to make a living,” said Jormaris  Figuera Fernández, 42, speaking outside a shack of plywood planks and a tarpaulin canopy that she shares with her husband. The two left Venezuela six years ago, at first joining legions of fellow citizens in neighboring Colombia, where the couple worked in construction, in the coffee fields and other jobs. They later tried their luck in Brazil and Chile, before returning to Colombia. Then in 2023 they set out for the United States, a perilous trip that began in the Darién Gap, the unforgiving strip of rainforest between Colombia and Panama. World & Nation What’s in a name? Gulf of America? Mexican America? Mexico’s president pokes fun at Trump’s suggestion to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Jan. 8, 2025 “We heard a lot of people were crossing the jungle — even some with crutches, very overweight people, pregnant women,” said Figuera. “We figured we could do it too.” It took six weeks to reach Mexico . For more than a year, Figuera cleaned houses in the southern state of Chiapas while her husband worked in the fields. World & Nation Mexico cracks down on drugs and migrants. Will it be enough to stop Trump tariffs? Mexico’s president walks a fine line between pleasing her constituents and placating Trump. Dec. 12, 2024 The two eventually made their way to Mexico City, paying about $200 for their shanty in La Soledad. It features a bed, a couch, throw rugs, a table and a hot plate that, like other appliances in the camp, runs off pirated electricity. It costs about 25 cents each time they use the restroom in a nearby bar. Advertisement Following Trump’s election in November, hundreds fled La Soledad, embarking for the border with the idea of crossing into U.S. territory before he took office. But Figuera and her husband remained, hopeful of gaining legal entry — unlike her son, who, she said, was twice caught crossing the border illegally, spent four months in U.S. custody and is now in New York awaiting a deportation hearing. “He said it’s very hard, very cold, and extremely difficult to find work without papers,” Figuera said. Faced with Trump’s shut-the-border dictates , the couple has relented: They plan to return to Colombia — once they figure out a way to get there. “We came here with a dream, with a purpose — to arrive to the United States to help our families,” Figuera said, tears welling in her eyes. “We are going back now with nothing. Depressed. Deflated. We have failed.” Waiting and seeing The two boys, aged 2 and 4, romped through the labyrinth of La Soledad, under lines of drying laundry, past deliverymen pushing stacked handcarts an...",

Print In the early days of President Trump’s first administration, several Kern County organizations launched a tip line people could contact if they spotted immigration enforcement activities underway. Nearly three weeks ago, the hotline started ringing again. In panicked voices, callers reported witnessing U.S. Border Patrol agents questioning Latinos in parking lots and gas stations — and detaining people in large numbers. In some cases, they said, a loved one had been detained. Business Column: Inside the Bakersfield raids that showed how Trump’s immigration policies will sow chaos The U.S. Border Patrol ran rampant through Bakersfield in what immigration advocates say was nothing but racial profiling aimed at intimidation. More such raids are coming. Jan. 22, 2025 The Rapid Response Network of Kern sprang into action. Organization staff and volunteers fanned out across the Bakersfield area — to a Home Depot, a swap meet and other locations where the Border Patrol had been spotted. As they confirmed the raids, they attempted to document the scenes, including any violations of rights or use of force, as well as recording the names of people being detained and interviewing witnesses. Advertisement By the time the multi-day Border Patrol operation ended, 78 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to the El Centro sector of the Border Patrol. Border Patrol Chief Agent Gregory K. Bovino, who leads the El Centro sector in the Imperial Valley along the Mexican border, said in statements on social media that agents had detained two child rapists and “other criminals.” He said agents also arrested people for being in the U.S. unlawfully. Advocates on the scene, meanwhile, said that the operation indiscriminately targeted Latino farmworkers and day laborers, and that far more people were detained. They questioned why agents from El Centro — 300 miles south — were conducting operations so far away from the border. Advertisement Representatives for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to requests for comment. Though the rapid-response network is not designed to intervene in raids, its members played a vital support role by chronicling the operation and offering counsel for those who were detained, said Rosa Lopez, a senior policy advocate for the ACLU of Southern California, which is a partner in Kern County’s network. Rapid-response networks emerged across the state during the first Trump administration. The community-led groups became a first line of defense for immigrants overwhelmed by threats of raids and mass deportation. Advertisement The premise was straightforward: People who see immigration or border agents in their community call or text a hotline. A dispatcher notifies volunteers, who respond to the reported address to confirm whether there is, in fact, an active operation. If verified, the dispatcher can send out a legal observer to monitor the situation, as well as an attorney to provide legal assistance. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and with immigrants facing fewer deportation threats under the Biden administration, many networks pivoted to providing people with information about vaccines and food assistance. But after Trump was elected in November amid promises to carry out the largest deportation operation in American history, local organizations are dusting off the rapid-response networks they built eight years ago. In the first days of his new term, Trump issued a slew of executive orders closing down legal avenues to asylum and declaring illegal immigration a national emergency at the southern border. Public sentiment could be on his side. A recent poll from the New York Times and Ipsos found that 55% of Americans strongly or somewhat support deporting all immigrants in the country illegally. Along with providing legal defense to immigrants detained by authorities, much of what the networks do is preventative. They inform community members about their rights to ask for a warrant if ICE shows up at their door and to not answer questions. They urge people to document the encounter and report the incident. They also ensure families have an emergency plan. They use text messaging and social media to warn people of confirmed operations, and more often, to tamp down the rumors that can spur people to stay home from work and keep their kids home from school.

Print During a visit to Los Angeles burn areas Friday, President Trump sought to convince California officials that the state’s system of water management needs a dramatic overhaul. Trump announced that he was set to approve an executive order “to open up the pumps and valves in the north.” “We want to get that water pouring down here as quickly as possible, let hundreds of millions of gallons of water flow down into Southern California, and that’ll be a big benefit to you,” he told a gathering of city, county and state officials at Los Angeles Fire Department Station 69 in Pacific Palisades.

Water managers and researchers have said that Southern California’s cities are not currently short of water, and that the region’s reservoirs are at record high levels following plentiful deliveries of supplies in 2023 and 2024. Earlier this week, Trump issued an order to put “people over fish,” ordering federal agencies to restart work to “route more water” from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to other parts of the state “for use by the people there who desperately need a reliable water supply.” Advertisement Trump has also said he wants to tie federal aid for wildfire recovery to whether California accepts changes in water policy. President Trump greets Gov. Gavin Newsom after arriving at LAX on Friday. (Mark Schiefelbein / Associated Press) Gov. Gavin Newsom, who met Trump briefly at Los Angeles International Airport, has said a change in water management in Northern California would not have affected the fire response. The governor’s office said on social media this week that California “pumps as much water now as it could under prior Trump-era policies,” and that “there is no shortage of water in Southern California.” Advertisement Even with ample supplies in reservoirs, local water systems were pushed to their limits as the fires rapidly spread, driven by strong winds. When the L.A. County water system lost pressure in parts of Pacific Palisades, some fire hydrants ran dry in high-elevation areas , hindering the firefighting effort. Newsom last week ordered an investigation into the loss of water pressure to hydrants and the lack of water available from a reservoir in Pacific Palisades that was out of commission for repairs . “There was plenty of water available in Southern California at the time these fires broke out,” said Bruce Reznik, executive director of the environmental advocacy group Los Angeles Waterkeeper. “The president’s proposed solutions for improving water security in our region are impractical and based on a faulty understanding of the state’s water system.” During a visit to North Carolina earlier Friday, Trump said he intended to find out “why they aren’t releasing the water.” Trump similarly tried to alter California water regulations and policies during his first term. But when his administration adopted water rules that weakened environmental protections in the delta, the state and conservation groups successfully challenged the changes in court. That cleared the way for the Biden administration, working together with Newsom’s administration, to develop the current plan and the supporting biological opinions, which determine how much water can be pumped and how river flows are managed in the delta. Advertisement The rules govern the operation of dams, aqueducts and pumping plants in the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, two of the world’s largest water systems, which deliver supplies to millions of acres of farmland and about 30 million people. Pumping to supply farms and cities has contributed to the ecological degradation of the Delta, where the fish species that are listed as threatened or endangered include steelhead trout, two types of Chinook salmon, longfin smelt, delta smelt and green sturgeon. Trump indicated he intends to seek to weaken protections for the delta smelt, a finger-length species that has suffered major declines and is thought to be nearing extinction in the wild. “They talk about the delta smelt,” Trump said. “It doesn’t have to be protected. The people of California have to be protected.” U.S. Rep. Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield) thanked...",

The new church-state case could yield a potentially momentous decision that could change public schools in much of the nation. Los Angeles and other large cities have been leaders in establishing charter schools as an option for students. Advertisement They are privately run public schools, but until now, the law has required that they may not be sectarian or affiliated with a church. The Supreme Court’s conservative majority may see this as discrimination against religion. The appeal granted review on Friday argued that a state violates the 1st Amendment’s protection for the free exercise of religion if it excludes religious schools from its public-funded charter schools. Advertisement The court is likely to hear arguments in late April in the case of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School vs. Drummond. The case has had complicated history in Oklahoma. The Catholic Archidocese of Oklahoma City applied to establish St. Isidore as a religious virtual charter school and won an initial approval. But the state’s attorney general and the state Supreme Court said the state’s constitution did not permit public funding for a religious school. Advertisement The new school’s advocates appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Since 2017, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has led the court in a series of rulings holding that churches and church-run groups may not be excluded from public benefits on the grounds that they are religious. The justices opened the door for parents to send their children to religious schools in Montana and Maine. Citing those rulings, religious rights advocates say Oklahoma should allow a Catholic school to qualify as a state-funded charter.

Fauci has faced regular threats to his life and has received federal protection for years, but it was discontinued this week, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is the latest in a string of former Trump aides-turned-critics to see their federal protection canceled despite ongoing threats to their safety. Speaking to reporters in North Carolina on Friday, Trump said he wouldn’t feel any responsibility if harm befell the former government officials. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security issues, said that Fauci’s federal security detail was ended on Thursday and that he has since hired private security. Advertisement When asked about Fauci and Trump’s former national security advisor, John Bolton, the president said, “They all made a lot of money. They can hire their own security, too.” Trump earlier this week revoked protection details for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his top aide, Brian Hook, as well as Bolton, who have all faced threats from Iran since they took hard-line stances on the Islamic Republic during Trump’s first administration.

Print WASHINGTON — Even before the first phase is completed, the fragile cease-fire agreement that has paused 15 months of war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas faces increasingly long odds of lasting or even reaching phase 2. The deal — drafted by the Biden administration last year, negotiated for months with Qatar and Egypt, and finally last week pushed over the finish line with help from Trump representatives — stopped Israeli bombardment of the coastal enclave, freed the first three of several dozen Israeli hostages held by Hamas and released 90 of thousands of Palestinians being held by Israel. Up to 30 more Israeli hostages and several hundred Palestinians are due to be freed in this first phase of the cease-fire, before a second phase is scheduled to start in six weeks. At that point, negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict are supposed to commence. Advertisement But there are growing signs the second phase, which would also require the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, will never happen. Here are some of the reasons. Trump will be more hands-off than Biden President Trump helped push the cease-fire agreement ahead of his inauguration. He said he wanted the conflict off his plate. But on his first day in office, Trump signaled a hands-off approach to the conflict. “It’s not our war, it’s their war,” he told reporters. Advertisement Significantly, he said he was “not confident” the cease-fire would last. Without strong U.S. pressure to keep cease-fire talks going, chances of ever reaching phase 2 look dim. Trump is also staunchly pro-Israel, making it more difficult for the U.S. to mediate. Rather than try to restrain Israel from using violence, in the past Trump has appeared to encourage it. Last year he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “do what it takes” to end the conflict. His administration appointees are also ardent supporters of Israel who have openly questioned Palestinians’ right to sovereignty. Advertisement His pick to be ambassador to Israel is former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian who has said there is “no such thing” as a Palestinian and opposes creation of a sovereign Palestinian state. And on Tuesday, Trump’s choice for the U.S. ambassadorship at the United Nations, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), testified at her Senate confirmation that she agreed with Israeli officials who contend that Israel has a “biblical right” to the land, including all of the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, much of which is claimed by the Palestinians. Where Trump’s interest in the Middle East remains strong, however, is in Saudi Arabia. He badly wants to broker an accord that would open diplomatic ties — and lucrative business deals — between Saudi Arabia and Israel. But Saudi Arabia is now demanding any deal be conditioned on a “credible path” for Palestinians to establish an independent state, something Trump has long shunned. Israel under pressure at home to keep attacking Gaza Netanyahu is under pressure from right-wing members of his coalition government to resume bombardment of the Gaza Strip until Hamas is destroyed. Several have said they received assurances from Netanyahu that after the first phase of the truce ends, Israeli troops and fighter jets will once again launch in and over Gaza. Once hostages are released in the first phase, Netanyahu may have strong political incentives to resume fighting. The next releases are to come Saturday, when Hamas has indicated that four more female captives will be handed over. Netanyahu, who now holds the narrowest of majorities in the Knesset, or parliament, needs to stave off defections because the collapse of his government makes him vulnerable to a criminal court case against him on corruption charges, which he has been able to place largely on hold because of the ongoing war. Advertisement Meanwhile, Netanyahu this week intensified Israeli attacks on the occupied West Bank. These operations, which have already claimed numerous Palestinian lives, came after Trump revoked Biden administration sanctions on radical Jewish settlers who have rampaged through the West Bank destroying property and killing a number of Palestinian residents. Not only has Netanyahu refused to countenance an eventual independent Palestinian state, he repeatedly ignored pleas from U.S. and Arab mediators over the last year to plan for a postwar Gaza Strip system of governance. In the last few days, Netanyahu has also been at pains to publicly minimize any role in Gaza’s governance for the Palestinian Authority, which has limited ruling powers in the occupied West Bank. Pressure on Netanyahu also c...",

(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) By Austin Sarat Jan. 24, 2025 3 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print The Death Penalty Information Center’s recent annual report contained good news for those opposed to capital punishment. The number of new death sentences remained small by historical standards in 2024, at 26 nationwide, as did the number of executions, 25, and the number of people on death row, about 2,250. Public support for the death penalty, meanwhile, remained at a five-decade low, 53%. But the report’s most important finding for the future of capital punishment concerns the stark generational differences of opinion on the death penalty. The center cited a recent Gallup poll illustrating that the way people think about death sentences  now depends heavily on their age. “Less than half of U.S. adults born after 1980 — those in the millennial and Generation Z birth cohorts — favor the death penalty,” Gallup noted. “At the same time, roughly six in 10 adults in older generations are in favor of such laws. Two decades ago, there were no meaningful age differences in views of the death penalty.” Advertisement Support for capital punishment is declining from one generation to the next — from 62% among the so-called Silent Generation, people born before the end of World War II, to 42% in Gen Z, today’s youngest voters. This suggests the death penalty in the United States is dying one generation at a time. Opinion Editorial: Of course the death penalty is racist. And it would be wrong even if it weren’t Racism taints every stage of death penalty proceedings in California, as the state Supreme Court should acknowledge. It’s present in other criminal sentences as well. May 7, 2024 This pattern has been widely noted and consistent for years. USA Today documented striking age-related differences in support for the death penalty more than a decade ago. A 2015 YouGov survey found that “young Americans are much more skeptical of the death penalty than their elders.” What explains the capital punishment generation gap? For older generations, as University of Michigan law professors Samuel Gross and Pheobe Ellsworth noted in a 2001 paper, “Stories of grisly murders and the suffering families of the victims were more prevalent and more vividly described in the media than stories of unfair convictions.” But younger generations have grown up with more stories of arbitrariness, discrimination and error in America’s death penalty system. Advertisement Moreover, as fewer people are sentenced to death and executed each year — most of them in a shrinking number of states — the death penalty system looks ever more arbitrary and capricious . Opinion Editorial: Death penalty’s retreat is excruciatingly slow Florida jurors and Oregon’s governor were unlikely heroes in the fight against executions last year. But elsewhere the death mill continues to grind. Jan. 2, 2023 This new script is exemplified by stories of death row inmates who have been freed by revelations of injustice and of others who were executed despite strong cases for exoneration. The Death Penalty Information Center noted the “significant media attention” surrounding “the milestone of 200 death row exonerations,” which the country reached in July when a California man was found to have been wrongfully convicted. Younger generations’ exposure to America’s death penalty has come at a time when, as Gallup noted, “many states had moratoriums on the death penalty or repealed laws that allowed capital punishment … often motivated by cases in which death-row inmates were later found innocent.” That may explain why younger people, as the Death Penalty Information Center suggests, regard capital punishment as a “relic of another era.” Advertisement Writing about the way different generations come to see the world in different ways, the political theorist Michael Walzer has described what he calls a “gradual pedagogy” that is shaped and reshaped by experience. The reshaping of the way younger Americans think about capital punishment has led to a generational gap in attitudes that “has been widening every year for the past 20 years,” as the Death Penalty Information Center noted. This in itself may not bring the death penalty in the United States to an end in the near term, but it’s a reason to believe that it’s headed inexorably in that direction.

Print WASHINGTON — President Trump’s executive order rejecting liberal “gender ideology” and restoring the “biological truth” of two sexes sets the stage for a legal battle in California and the blue states over transgender students and adults. Trump says his administration will only recognize “two sexes, male and female” in federal policy, and not “gender identity” that differs from “biological reality.” “These sexes are not changeable,” he said in the executive order issued this week . “Sex is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of ‘gender identity.’” Advertisement Trump’s order fulfills a campaign promise and is likely to have a broad sweep in federal rules, from passports to prisons. “Agency forms that require an individual’s sex shall list male or female,” it said, and prison officials “shall ensure that males are not detained in women’s prisons.” But the order, which makes no mention of transgender people, conflicts with laws in California and other blue states that forbid discrimination based on gender identity. Advertisement Those state laws are not repealed by a change in federal policy, but they are likely to face legal challenges, including from new Trump administration regulations. “In practice, what this order means is that the administration is not only denying that transgender people have rights, but that they exist,” said Georgetown Law Professor David Cole, the former legal director for the ACLU. “There are about 1.5 million people in the United States who are transgender, and that reality cannot be denied with an executive order.” Jennifer Pizer, legal director for Lambda Legal in Los Angeles, sees the Trump order as an opening salvo in what could be a long legal battle. Advertisement “This is an ideological crusade trying to turn the clock back. They are trying to establish the principle that there’s no duty to respect trans people,” she said. “Trans people exist. We can’t erase them by writing a new definition.” World & Nation Supreme Court sounds ready to OK laws that ban hormone treatments for trans teens Conservative court could limit hormone treatments for transgender adolescents. Dec. 4, 2024 The Supreme Court has not ruled on whether government discrimination against transgender people is unconstitutional. Until now, it has mostly deferred to the states. But in 2020, Cole won a 6-3 ruling in the Supreme Court that forbids job discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. The federal Civil Rights Act says employers may not discriminate based on race or sex, and the court in an opinion by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said discrimination against LGBTQ employees was discrimination based on sex. That decision could prove significant in legal fights over Trump administration regulations and blue-state laws as the courts seek to clarify the meaning of federal statutes, including civil rights and education laws. “The [Supreme] Court has already ruled that transgender discrimination is by definition a form of sex discrimination,” Cole said. However, the court’s conservative majority has signaled it is likely to uphold laws in Republican-led states that limit the rights of transgender adolescents. California and other Democratic-led states do not restrict doctors from prescribing puberty blockers or hormones from those under age 18 who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But in December, the justices heard arguments in a Tennessee case and sounded ready to uphold that state’s ban on these treatments for teens. While a ruling for Tennessee would affirm similar laws in the Republican-led states, it would not impose those restrictions in California.

One possibility is to reinterpret Title IX, the 1972 education law that forbids schools and colleges from discriminating on the basis of sex. Last year, the Education Department under the Biden administration announced new regulations under Title IX favored by progressives.

Print The United States is ground zero for the H5N1 bird flu. Since March 2024, when the virus was first reported in a Texas dairy herd, the virus has killed one person , sickened scores more, contaminated the nation’s food supply, felled dozens of house pets , infected more than 900 dairy herds across 16 states , and caused the deaths of millions of wild animals and commercially raised chickens, ducks and turkeys. So how President Trump and his administration will deal with this widespread, potentially deadly virus, which scientists say is just a mutation or two away from becoming a full-blown human pandemic, is a question many health officials and infectious disease experts are now asking. And so far — say the few who will go on the record about their concerns — things are not looking promising. On Monday, Trump issued an executive order that will remove the U.S. from the World Health Organization — a 76-year old international agency created, in part, to share data and information about global pandemics. Advertisement He has also shuttered the Biden-era White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness, which was directed by Congress to streamline and coordinate the nation’s response to burgeoning pandemics, such as avian flu. Since the office’s formation in 2023, it has initiated multiagency coordinated efforts to “test” the nation’ s preparedness for novel disease outbreaks, and has provided advice and coordination regarding vaccine development and availability among various health agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. A visit to the office’s website Wednesday morning showed a “404 Page Not Found” error message. And on Tuesday evening, news broke that the Trump administration delivered instructions to a number of agencies within the department of Health and Human Services to put a “pause” on all health communications. The department did not respond to questions about the issue. However, a note from a Human Services spokesman to a Times reporter on a different topic noted that the agency “issued a pause on mass communications and public appearances that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health.” The spokesman said the pause was temporary and set up to allow the new administration’s appointees “to set up a process for review and prioritization.” Science & Medicine A wave of cat deaths from bird flu prompts new rules on pet food production Cats — both large cats in captivity and pet house cats — across multiple states have been dying from H5N1 bird flu. Now, federal agencies are enforcing new rules to help keep the virus out of pet food. Jan. 18, 2025 Experts say while we’re still in just the first week of the new administration, and things could change, these developments don’t bode well for a transparent and timely response to the growing avian flu crisis. “More cases of H5N1 are occurring in the United States than in any other country,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University in Providence, R.I. “Pausing our health communications at a time when states are scrambling to contain this virus is dangerously misguided. This will make America less healthy and will worsen the virus’s economic tolls.” Advertisement Experts also say the new administration’s moves could lead to economic and social isolation for many Americans. Other nations may begin to question the health and safety of exported agricultural products, such as dairy, livestock, poultry and meat, as well the health of Americans who want to travel internationally. “I can foresee countries slapping travel and trade restrictions on the U.S. It’ll affect millions of Americans,” said Lawrence Gostin, a legal scholar at Georgetown University. Although the WHO does not typically support travel restrictions or trade bans, independent nations can call for such measures. In January 2020, Trump temporarily suspended entry to all non-U.S. citizens coming in from China. Other nations, said Gostin, could take similar measures if they feel the U.S. is not being transparent or openly communicating information about the H5N1 outbreak. And without a seat at the WHO’s negotiating table, where new pandemic guidelines are currently being drawn, the U.S. may find itself on the outside looking in. “With our withdrawal, we’d be ceding influence leadership” to China and other U.S. adversaries, said Gostin — the exact opposite of what we should be doing during such a precarious moment for a potentially emerging pandemic. “When the next [WHO] director general is elected, it’ll be China that will be pulling the strings — not the United States,” he said. “Our adversaries will be setting the global rules that we’re going to have to live by.” Climate & Environment Trump wants to upend Calif...",

(Leo Correa / Associated Press) Advertisement Hayat Tahrir al Sham, the Islamist group that now rules the country, has vowed to protect Alawites and other minorities. They insist that incidents targeting Alawites are not a matter of official policy but the fault of undisciplined individuals or factions, and that the interim government would punish perpetrators. Still, critics say there’s little accountability, with victims left in limbo between the kaleidoscope of jihadi groups working with the new government and Hayat Tahrir al Sham’s inability to police everywhere. “The problem is that everyone speaks in the name of the Hayat, but when someone comes to your house or arrests you, there’s no way to verify their identity,” said Ghadeer Al-Khayer, an Alawite who works for the Health Ministry. Al-Khayer, a jovial man with an earnest voice, lives in Qardaha,  the Assad family’s ancestral town that is also home to the mausoleum of the ousted president’s precedessor and father, Hafez. In recent weeks, Al-Khayer has watched bands of fighters periodically descend on the mausoleum for a bout of vandalism; the building’s walls now stand defaced with graffiti cursing Hafez Assad’s soul and a bevy of revolutionary slogans. The interior shows signs of scorching; the coffin is nowhere to be found.

Then they heard a militia leader was going to be hanged. Dec. 19, 2024 As a community leader here, Al-Khayer has taken a conciliatory approach toward the new Islamist administration. He curses Assad as freely as any rebel, dismissing the former dictator as an incompetent coward who entangled his fellow Alawites in war crimes before abandoning them. He rejects the sectarian lens that he says unfairly painted Alawites as being the sole or primary beneficiaries of Assad’s rule. “There was an ...",

Print MELBOURNE — As flames engulfed swaths of Los Angeles County this month and U.S. fire authorities scrambled to coordinate help from overseas, one longtime firefighting partner was left off their list: Australia . Mexico and Canada both sent personnel and equipment to the front lines, and the Australian government publicly offered to help as part of a long-standing agreement with the United States. But U.S. officials never requested it. They knew that Australia, heading into its own fire season, was already dealing with a recent fire in Victoria state that burned more than 187,800 acres and took 21 days to contain. Advertisement “Requests for international assistance are typically sent first to the countries experiencing the least wildfire activity as they are more likely to be able to send firefighters and equipment,” said Erin McDuff, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Office of Wildland Fire. “Australia, in particular, has recently experienced numerous severe wildfires that have taxed their available firefighting resources.” California Hellish fires, low pay, trauma: California’s Forest Service firefighters face a morale crisis A federal firefighter’s viral resignation letter is highlighting the job’s low pay and harsh working conditions in the age of climate change. June 14, 2022 Yet the absence of Australian help amid two of the most destructive fires in California’s history speaks to the increasing fragility of such international agreements in the age of climate change. Advertisement For more than 20 years, the agreement between the U.S. and Australia has operated on a simple principle: Located in opposite hemispheres, the two countries’ fire seasons have historically been asynchronous, allowing the side with less fire activity to send firefighting personnel or equipment to the other. But climate change is extending fire seasons across the world, spreading existing resources thin. Many now fear that the system of cooperation is beginning to crack. “Resource-sharing agreements are becoming absolutely vital as countries are affected by prolonged outbreaks of extreme wildfires,” said Rick McRae, a wildfire management expert at the University of New South Wales Canberra. Advertisement “But if you look at California alone, there’s just been a continuous run of bad events,” he said. “The usual concept of fire seasons has had to be abandoned.” : : Would more help from Australia have made a difference? Some experts have said the sheer intensity and speed of the fires rendered it pointless to simply throw more people and equipment into the mix. Even with more than 10,000 firefighters battling the flames, ground crews in L.A. have said they were overwhelmed, and planes that spray fire retardant  were often hamstrung by the winds. “If we had 100 air tankers there, would it have done any good? I don’t know. Maybe not,” said Joel Kerley, the chief executive of 10 Tanker, an Albuquerque-based aerial firefighting company contracted by the U.S. Forest Service to combat the L.A.-area fires. “But I’m at a point right where you gotta try. We are getting our butts kicked by these fires, and something has to change.” Hector Cerna, 39, of Palmdale works to put out hot spots in Alpine National Park, in Australia’s Victoria state, on Jan. 18, 2020.

Print A day after the Trump administration moved to vastly expand its powers to carry out fast-track deportations as part of a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, the American Civil Liberties Union has sued to try to stop it. The new policy, known as “expedited removal,” empowers immigration officials to swiftly deport those who have entered the country illegally without going before a judge — even if they have been here for up to two years and are far from the border.  The policy could pave the way for mass deportations. In posting the policy earlier this week, officials wrote that it would “enhance national security and public safety” and reduce government costs. Advertisement But lawyers for the ACLU, working on behalf of a New York immigrant services organization called Make the Road New York, argued that the policy violates the due process clause of the 5th Amendment, as well as the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. “President Trump’s draconian decision to fast track mass deportations violates hundreds of thousands’ fundamental right to a fair day in court,” Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. She called the effort “cruel” and “extremist” and said it would “leave children without parents, families without their breadwinners, businesses without workers, and immigrant communities in shambles.” Officials with the federal Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. Advertisement The expedited removal policy announced Tuesday in a posted notice substantially resembles a similar policy that was rolled out in the summer of 2019 during Trump’s first term. The ACLU and other groups promptly sued , and the matter was tied up in court for months. When President Biden assumed office, he rescinded the policy, and the litigation stalled. Under the expedited removal policy, the Department of Homeland Security sought to expand a removal process that had been in place near the border for decades. That allowed immigration officials to remove people who have been in the United States for less than two weeks if they were apprehended within 100 miles of the border. Advertisement Politics ‘Freaked out’: Fear, uncertainty grip California’s immigrant community as Trump rolls out crackdown plan Worry spreads over what Trump’s orders will mean for California immigrants. One in eight state residents are undocumented or live with a family member who is. Jan. 22, 2025 The Trump administration sought to expand this across the country and to broaden the period from two weeks to two years. Then, as now, legal advocates for immigrants argued that the move was a “major departure” from “a consistent century-long norm of providing all noncitizens within the United States with notice, access to counsel, an opportunity to prepare and a contested hearing” before they can be deported. The new process means that a Border Patrol agent could pull someone over and determine whether or not they should be deported in less than an hour. “This is less process that people get when they get a traffic ticket and with far greater consequences,” said Anand Balakrishnan, an attorney at the ACLU’s Immigrant Rights Project and lead counsel on the case. And often, he said, agents make mistakes. “These are sort of the reasons why no other administration has expanded it in this way,” he said. “It creates an entirely unaccountable system of unilateral authority in the hands of individual officers to make incredibly weighty choices.” More to Read What did Trump’s team learn from past legal battles?

Print A memo from the Department of Justice said state and local officials could be targeted for not complying with President Trump’s crackdown on immigration enforcement. California officials cited the state’s sanctuary law as their defense against the Trump administration’s threats to investigate and possibly prosecute officials who defy federal actions on immigration. WASHINGTON — As part of President Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration, the Department of Justice will be empowered to investigate and even criminally prosecute government officials who do not comply with restrictive orders on immigration. The move, outlined in an internal memo reported by multiple news outlets Wednesday, effectively puts a target on the backs of many state and local California officials, who have vociferously defended measures designed to make it possible for undocumented immigrants to work and get an education in the state. The memo from acting U.S. Deputy Atty. Gen. Emil Bove instructs state and local officials to comply with federal immigration directives and echoes lines Trump hammered on the campaign trail about the threat of undocumented immigrants in the country — such as gangs, drugs and crime. Studies have found that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than American citizens. Advertisement “Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing, and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands,” the memo reads, adding that the U.S. Attorney’s office and Department of Justice will investigate wrongdoers. The statement also mentions a newly established “Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group” to challenge state and local sanctuary cities laws. Politics What did Trump’s team learn from past legal battles? Immigrant advocates prepare to find out Immigrants rights groups are already contesting President Trump’s sweeping executive orders aimed at combating illegal immigration. Jan. 21, 2025 As news of the internal memo spread Wednesday, agencies and officials began to assess how they would respond to its threat of investigations and possible prosecution. “This is a scare tactic, plain and simple. The president is attempting to intimidate and bully state and local law enforcement into carrying out his mass deportation agenda for him,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said in a statement. “My team is reviewing the U.S. Department of Justice’s memo, and we’ll be prepared to take legal action if the Trump Administration’s vague threats turn to illegal action.” Advertisement Bonta pointed to California’s sanctuary law — approved in 2017 and known as Senate Bill 54 — which bars local law enforcement agencies from using public money to play a direct role in immigration enforcement and prohibits police from transferring people to immigration authorities except in certain cases, such as when people have been convicted of certain violent felonies and misdemeanors. In 2019, a federal court rejected a lawsuit to stop SB54 from the previous Trump administration, ruling that the state laws could continue to be enforced. The city of Huntington Beach sued California this month over the constitutionality of the law. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office declined to comment. Los Angeles City Councilmember Bob Blumenfield, who represents a district in the San Fernando Valley that includes many immigrant groups, hadn’t read the memo but said that L.A.’s “sanctuary city” policy doesn’t stop the federal government from deporting people. Advertisement “The question is whether we use our federal resources as a city to aid and abet that deportation,” Blumenfield said. “Legally, I think that they’re not able to force us to do that. “You always have to be concerned; Trump doesn’t play by the rules,” he added. Asked about Trump’s order, Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of public instruction who has taken a stand against helping ICE, said, “I don’t feel threatened. I’m happy to talk to the president right now. People don’t need to get threats.” Since taking office Monday, Trump has signed a slew of executive orders aimed at reining in illegal immigration — among them, cutting off federal funding for sanctuary cities, ending birthright citizenship for children of parents in the country illegally and shutting down an app used by asylum seekers to apply for entry into the United States. At the UC Board of Regents meeting Wednesday in San Francisco, leaders acknowledged the “fear and uncertainty” among undocumented students — who are estimated to number 86,800 in California, according to the Higher Ed Immi...",

Print Promises made, promises kept, President Trump liked to crow during his first term, sometimes deservedly. He’s only days into his second term and already he’s making that claim after a torrent of executive orders. In no case is his boast more justified, if shameful, than for his Day 1 blanket order pardoning 1,583 rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, commuting the sentences of those most responsible — and violent — and dismissing all remaining cases. Trump vowed at rallies throughout his 2024 campaign that once back in office he’d immediately free “the J-6 hostages.” Yet in keeping that promise, he broke a long-forgotten one on the same subject. He made it not at a political rally but in a videotaped recording at the White House, a day after the seven-hour insurrection was put down and as he faced bipartisan condemnation for his complicity. Advertisement Opinion Columnist Jackie Calmes Jackie Calmes brings a critical eye to the national political scene. She has decades of experience covering the White House and Congress. Read more from Jackie Calmes The president who’d inspired the mob to try to keep him in power began that evening by calling Jan. 6 not a “ day of love ” among patriots, as he says these days, but a “heinous attack on the United States Capitol.” And then, still sounding like a normal president, Trump said this: “Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem. I immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders. America is and must always be a nation of law and order. The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy. To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay .” At the time, the only lies in that passage seemed to be Trump’s contention that he “immediately deployed” forces to quell the tumult that directly or indirectly caused the deaths of nine people, including five police officers. Now we know the whole thing was a lie: Trump wasn’t outraged. He didn’t really condemn the “demonstrators” — they were pro-Trump, after all, as shown by the banners on poles that were weaponized against police. He didn’t care that they were lawless or violent despite the carnage he witnessed watching hours of televised coverage alone in the White House, ignoring aides’ and family members’ pleas to intervene. Politics Jan. 6 rioters freed by Trump include Californians and those who assaulted officers Rioters who were convicted and imprisoned for their roles in the violent attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 were being released after receiving pardons and commutations from Trump. Jan. 21, 2025 Most of all, Trump didn’t really believe his rioters should “pay.” And now, just as Trump has paid no price for his role as the instigator of Jan. 6, he’s wiped the books clean for all the attackers, negating verdicts by scores of juries of their peers. Advertisement A couple of examples of his freed “hostages”: David Dempsey of Santa Ana, Calif., a man with a criminal history who pleaded guilty and got 20 years in prison, reflecting his cruelty against police. Read the prosecution report : Dempsey clambered over other rioters, using “his hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on” to batter officers trying to protect the Capitol and those within , including Trump’s vice president.

She came to the country without authorization when she was 2 years old and grew up working the fields of the Coachella Valley with her parents when school was out. She would be excited about the new opportunities her degree might present, but instead feels anxious every time she leaves the house. “I make sure that I say a good ‘goodbye’ to my parents,” she said. “I go out with more fear— anything can happen.” Advertisement Jimenez, 21, is like millions of undocumented immigrants living in California whose lives have become deeply woven into the state’s economy and social fabric — and who are rattled by the flurry of executive orders that President Trump has signed targeting immigrants. When Jimenez does leave home, she said she always carries a red card detailing her rights under the U.S. Constitution — one in her wallet, one in her car and another in the back of her phone case. “There’s a big chilling factor that’s going to emerge from this,” said Manuel Pastor, director of the Equity Research Institute at USC, who studies immigrants in the state. About 1 in 8 Californians are in the U.S. illegally or live with a family member who is. Most immigrants without legal status in the state, about 2.4 million people , have resided here for more than a decade, a factor that distinguishes California from other parts of the country.

But now Cervantes, 50, is worried that anyone without authorization will be rounded up. He entered the country illegally two decades ago, and said he has been working hard and following the law ever since. He said he assumed Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric wasn’t directed at people like him— until he learned of the president’s new executive order targeting birthright citizenship . As he travels around Southern California cutting lawns and blowing leaves, he said he intends to be “a little more alert,” especially in certain neighborhoods. “If I get deported, there’s not much I can do about it at that point,” he said Tuesday, as he and a friend chatted on a corner in Wilmington. Still, he added: “I do hope he only goes after people who come here to cause problems.” Trump signed a series of sweeping executive orders — some which are likely to face legal challenges — that could radically shift immigration enforcement in the country. The orders aim to end the refugee system, make it more difficult for some to become naturalized citizens, declare a national emergency at the border and enable local police to carry out some immigration officer functions , a role California has banned.

Print Critics have sounded alarms about the richest man on Earth and a close advisor to President Trump making what they saw as “Heil Hitler” gestures at an inauguration event. Musk dismissed those critiques, calling them “dirty tricks” by liberals and “legacy media propaganda” that have spread a narrative that his gestures were Nazi salutes. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a top aide to President Trump, drew and quickly dismissed a raft of condemnation from Democratic lawmakers, historians, politicians abroad and others across the internet after twice making what to some looked like a Nazi salute from an inauguration stage. Musk — who has endorsed antisemitic remarks and aligned himself with far-right factions, including the Alternative for Germany in that country — made the gestures during a giddy speech celebrating Trump’s return to power at an indoor rally Monday at Capital One Arena in Washington. “I just want to say thank you for making it happen. Thank you,” Musk said to the crowd. He slapped his chest with his right hand and then shot that hand out and up, open and flat and palm down, with his right arm rigidly extended. Advertisement He then turned and made a similar gesture in the opposite direction. “My heart goes out to you,” he said. Politics Smart business? Currying favor? Why big tech leaders are friending and funding Trump Tech leaders who once shunned Trump are now meeting with him, touting the opportunities they see in his next term, and bankrolling his inauguration. Jan. 11, 2025 Some defended Musk. The Anti-Defamation League, which works against antisemitism, offered Musk a pass with a post on X — a platform Musk owns. “It seems [Musk] made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge,” the group said. “In this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath.” Advertisement Others disagreed sharply. “Just to be clear, you are defending a Heil Hitler salute that was performed and repeated for emphasis and clarity,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wrote in response to ADL’s post on X. “People can officially stop listening to you as any sort of reputable source of information now. You work for them. Thank you for making that crystal clear to all.” Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) expressed shock at seeing Musk’s gesture at an inaugural event. “I never imagined we would see the day when what appears to be a Heil Hitler salute would be made behind the Presidential seal,” Nadler wrote on X. Advertisement The concerns were echoed by politicians across Europe, and sparked a sharp debate online — where people compared videos of Musk and Hitler side by side. Neo-Nazi and white supremacist figures around the world cheered the gestures. Others came to Musk’s defense. After one account on X called the uproar a “hoax” and part of what Musk had once called a “dirty tricks campaign” against him by liberals, Musk reposted the comment. “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired,” he wrote, before adding a sleeping-face emoji. Musk also suggested on X that debate over his gestures was evidence of “legacy media propaganda.” Politics Column: I watched Trump’s inauguration with a Democrat and a Republican.

At a confirmation hearing for Trump’s nominee for United Nations ambassador, Elise Stefanik, Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) asked her what she thought of Musk “doing two ‘Heil Hitler’ salutes last night at the president’s televised rally?” “No. Elon Musk did not do those salutes,” Stefanik said. She said Musk likes to cheer on Trump and is a visionary. Advertisement It was “simply not the case” that Musk made Nazi salutes, she said. “And to say so, the American people are smart — they see through it. They support Elon Musk.” Murphy then noted that neo-Nazi and other far-right and white supremacist extremists around the country had made clear online that they believed Musk had made Nazi salutes — which they approved of and thanked him for — and asked Stefanik what she made of that.

Print Legal experts say President Trump’s legal advisors appear to have learned from missteps during his first term that thwarted some of his plans for immigration. California, along with 17 other states, the District of Columbia and the city of San Francisco, sued Tuesday to challenge the executive order that aims to put an end to birthright citizenship. WASHINGTON  — A day after President Trump issued 11 executive orders cracking down on illegal immigration, advocates and a coalition of states led by California are preparing for court battles against an administration that appears to have learned from previous legal missteps made during his first term. Among the many sweeping changes in Trump’s orders were the declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, the revocation of birthright citizenship and the designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Immigrants and those who hoped to immigrate to the U.S. are reeling from the news. Thousands of migrants are indefinitely stranded in Mexico after Trump ended use of a phone app and canceled long-standing appointments by asylum seekers for legal entry. Afghan refugees who had been cleared for travel to the United States are now in limbo after Trump paused refugee resettlement. Undocumented immigrants in Chicago and other cities across the country stayed home out of fear of planned immigration raids. Advertisement Legal experts said subtle modifications to some of the orders reflected attempts by the Trump administration to beat back legal challenges preemptively. “Some of this stuff they have done is to try and preempt a lot of the issues that they bumped into last time,” said Amy Fischer, director of the refugee and migrant rights program at Amnesty International USA. Politics California, other states sue to block Trump executive order on birthright citizenship California, a coalition of other states and the city of San Francisco have sued the Trump administration over President Trump’s executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, calling it unconstitutional. Jan. 21, 2025 Opponents of Trump’s orders wasted no time in challenging them. A coalition comprising California, 17 other states, the District of Columbia and the city of San Francisco sued the federal government Tuesday over Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship , calling it unconstitutional and asking the court to block it from taking effect. The American Civil Liberties Union sued Monday night over the birthright citizenship order and submitted a legal filing in an ongoing case over the cancellation of appointments for asylum seekers at the border. Nayna Gupta, policy director at the left-leaning American Immigration Council, said the organization is also planning a lawsuit this week against Trump’s use of executive authority to “suspend the entry” of certain immigrants when doing so is deemed to be detrimental to national interests. Advertisement The ability to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border is suspended, according to Trump’s order, “until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased.” “Trump’s barrage of executive orders is calculated to create fear, create chaos, induce anxiety and drive our elected officials to capitulate and collaborate in a mass deportation agenda,” said Naureen Shah, deputy director of government affairs at the ACLU. “If we let Trump exert this kind of death grip over our communities now for immigration enforcement, we fear it will embolden Trump to come again and again for our civil rights.” Longtime critics of illegal immigration hailed the president’s actions. “Thanks to Donald Trump, America’s borders are about to get a lot more secure,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Bonsall) said in a post on X. Issa’s district runs along the border east of San Diego. Advertisement Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.), chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement that “nothing exemplifies a new day in America more than President Trump’s unwavering commitment to border security and restoring enforcement of our nation’s laws.” Some of Trump’s orders are predicated on what opponents contend to be legally dubious claims. Birthright citizenship, for example, is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. “He cannot unilaterally change that,” Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said Monday night on CNN. “But that’s the conversation — the chaos — he wants to create.” And in designating drug cartels as terrorist groups, Trump is preparing to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against them.

Print MEXICO CITY — Mexico will not object to President Trump’s plan to force asylum seekers detained at the southwestern border to wait in Mexico until their cases are heard in U.S. immigration courts, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday. Sheinbam did not endorse Trump’s controversial Remain in Mexico policy but said her nation would accept returned noncitizen asylum seekers as a “humanitarian” gesture, and would work to repatriate them to their homelands in Central America and elsewhere. Sheinbaum’s comments at her daily news conference were her first on  Trump’s inaugural-day blitz of executive orders, including several directly affecting Mexico and others overhauling U.S. immigration and border policy . Advertisement World & Nation Disappointment at border as Trump cancels immigration program The Trump administration cancelled a program aimed at easing the process of applying for asylum, leaving thousands of asylum-seekers disappointed and unsure of what to do next. Jan. 20, 2025 Sheinbaum, a leftist who took office in October, adopted a conciliatory tone and did not directly criticize Trump. She said that although Mexico must protect its sovereignty, its people must remain “calm” and “cool-headed.” “We have to avoid confrontations; that’s a responsibility,” said Sheinbaum, who was accompanied at the news conference by her foreign and security secretaries. “At the same time, we have to behave as equals, never subordinate. Defend our sovereignty, our independence and defend Mexicans.” As she responded to Trump’s decrees on a variety of contentious topics, from immigration to security to tariffs, she noted that several of his initiatives mirrored policies enacted during his first administration — including Remain in Mexico and the new U.S. declaration of a “national emergency” along the southwestern border. Advertisement Politics Trump signs orders to crack down on immigration, send troops to the border President Trump signed executive orders that will fundamentally change how the nation handles immigration, beefing up enforcement and deportations. Jan. 20, 2025 “It’s nothing new,” Sheinbaum said, adding that familiarly would aid in Mexico’s response. “That’s important to recognize.” Mexican citizens in the United States facing forced expulsion under Trump’s vowed mass deportation plans would be provided legal and other assistance — and would be in line for financial, logistical and other aid if returned to Mexico, Sheinbaum vowed. Mexicans in the U.S. should know they “are not alone,” Sheinbaum said. “They are heroes and heroines of la patria ,” she said. “That is how we are going to treat them.” The millions of Mexicans residing in the United States are also pillars of the Mexican economy, sending home more than $60 billion annually to relatives and others. A large-scale deportation could be a major blow to Mexico’s already fragile economy. Advertisement But the president again expressed the hope — which some analysts call illusory — that immigrant contributions would temper Trump’s deportation agenda. “Mexicans in the United States sustain a good part of the [U.S.] economy,” Sheinbaum said. Among Trump’s most provocative actions was an executive order saying that the U.S. would designate drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. But Sheinbaum downplayed widespread fears in Mexico that the decree could lead to unilateral U.S. military actions. Sheinbaum said that officials in new U.S. administration should work with with Mexico on binational security concerns. “They can and should act in their territory” she said, noting that organized crime also operates in the United States. “They in their territory, we in our territory.” “We all want to combat drug cartels, that is obvious,” Sheinbaum said. “We have to coordinate efforts, collaborate.” Sheinbaum was equally circumspect on the 25% tariffs Trump has vowed to impose on Mexican imports if the country fails to stop U.S.-bound traffic of drugs and migrants. Her government, Sheinbaum said, would commence “dialogue” on the matter with Trump, who has set Feb. 1 as a likely target date for imposing the tariffs. She made no mention of previous comments that Mexico would be forced to impose retaliatory tariffs should Trump proceed. Advertisement “It’s very important that everyone, the media, the people of Mexico, business leaders — everyone — that they remain calm and united,” Sheinbaum said. “Evaluating step by step, without getting ahead of ourselves.” Mexico’s export-oriented economy is closely tied to the United States, which is the destination of mo...",

Print Rioters, including those convicted of violent crimes against police officers, were being released from prisons around the country. Critics of Trump, including Capitol Police officers injured in the attack, said he had undermined American justice and made them less safe. Federal prosecutors described David Dempsey as “one of the most violent rioters” during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The Van Nuys man used flagpoles, metal crutches and broken pieces of furniture as he stormed the building, injuring police officers and fellow insurrectionists, according to court documents. He “viciously assaulted and injured police officers” for more than an hour “during one of the most violent stretches of time, at the scene of the most violent confrontations,” prosecutors wrote. In August, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to assaulting a law enforcement officer with a dangerous weapon and breaching the seat of Congress. Advertisement But on Tuesday, after President Trump granted sweeping pardons or commutations to everyone convicted of Jan. 6 offenses — more than 1,500 people — Dempsey was released, having served less than 3½ years, officials confirmed. Other Jan. 6 defendants — whom Trump called “hostages” — were also released across the country, based on Justice Department referrals of Trump’s orders to the Bureau of Prisons. “People are being released by the minute, it seems,” said Amy Collins, a Washington-based attorney who represents several Jan. 6 defendants, including Dempsey. “The DOJ actually seems to be jumping on board pretty quickly.” Advertisement Collins declined to comment on Dempsey’s case, but said the pardon process — after years of litigation, plea bargaining and trials — has been “surreal” for the defendants and their attorneys alike. “The fact that Trump kept his word and it has a direct result in our case, that’s a pretty big deal,” she said. “It’s such a unique situation.” The sudden release of so many Jan. 6 offenders marked a stunning end to years of grueling, costly work by federal prosecutors to identify, track down, prosecute and see sentenced hundreds of Trump loyalists and MAGA hard-liners who stormed and attacked the Capitol in a failed attempt to keep Trump illegitimately in power after he lost to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Advertisement World & Nation Oath Keepers’ Rhodes and Proud Boys’ Tarrio released from prison after Trump Jan. 6 clemency Former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes leave prison after Trump commuted their Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy sentences. Jan. 21, 2025 By the end of last year, the investigation had become the largest in the history of the Justice Department, which said it had charged 1,561 people in total, 590 of them with assaulting, resisting, impeding or obstructing law enforcement officers. It said nearly 980 had pleaded guilty, 210 others had been found guilty at trial, and 645 had been sentenced to at least some time behind bars. The Justice Department under Biden cast the prosecution effort as a vital check on the kind of political violence that was on display that day. It noted that 140 police officers had been assaulted, and millions of dollars in damage incurred. Trump has sought to recast the narrative. On the campaign trail he repeatedly lied about what happened, downplayed the severity of the attack, and suggested that those charged were being wrongly held as political prisoners. He promised he would issue pardons, but gave contradicting statements about whether he would pardon everyone charged or a narrower cohort. Even within his Republican Party, Trump faced resistance to pardons for the worst offenders, such as those who violently attacked police officers. Earlier this month, now-Vice President JD Vance told Fox News that if someone committed violence on Jan. 6, “obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned, and there’s a little bit of a gray area there.” Supporters of President Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons gather Tuesday at the D.C. Central Detention Facility in Washington. (Jose Luis Magana / Associated Press) And yet, within hours of being inaugurated, Trump had pardoned the vast majority of Jan. 6 defendants, including many convicted of violent acts. And he had commuted the sentences of the rest — 14 of the most high-profile defendants, including militia leaders charged with seditious conspiracy against the government — to time served, allowing their release from prison as well.

Unfortunately, it did not come from the petulant, vindictive President Trump, who sat on a dais crowded with Trump family members, former presidents and first ladies, and members of the new American oligarchy: tech billionaires who have bent the knee and opened their wallets to the man who has threatened to make life very, very difficult for them. Rather, the call for unity came from Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose stirring words should not be forgotten amid Trump’s subsequent torrent of lies, threats and bravado.

Jan. 19, 2025 “What makes this moment more than a passing ceremony is all who are watching it across the country — the people of this nation, the ordinary people doing extraordinary things,” said Klobuchar, who chaired Congress’ bipartisan inaugural ceremony committee. “President Kennedy, who at one point worked as a senator in this building and would often walk through this very rotunda, once said, ‘In a democracy, every citizen, regardless of interest in politics, holds office. Every one of us is in a position of responsibility.’ With that responsibility of citizenship comes an obligation not to seek out malice, as President Lincoln once reminded us, but to view others with a generosity of spirit despite our differences.” Fat chance.

Print President Trump’s executive order claims that birthright citizenship, enshrined in the Constitution, does not apply to the children of immigrants in the United States temporarily or without authorization. California is helping to lead a coalition of states suing to block the order as unconstitutional. California, a coalition of other states and the city of San Francisco sued the federal government Tuesday over President Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship via executive order — calling it an unconstitutional directive that flies in the face of long-standing legal precedent. “I have one message for President Trump: I’ll see you in court,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said during a morning news conference — calling the order “unconstitutional and quite frankly un-American.” The lawsuit asks the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts to block Trump’s order from taking effect — which it is meant to do in less than 30 days — and to “ensure that the rights of American-born children impacted by this order remain in effect while litigation proceeds,” Bonta said. “The president has overstepped his authority by a mile with this order, and we will hold him accountable.” Advertisement Bonta said Trump’s order would affect more than 20,000 babies born in California each year. He noted the state is home to some 11 million immigrants, who make up almost 30% of the state’s population and a third of its taxpaying workers. “I want to be clear that this isn’t some theoretical legal disagreement I have with the president,” he said. “If allowed to stand, this order would endanger thousands of U. S. citizens who will be born in the next year — real children and families just trying to live their lives at peace.” Politics Trump said he would revoke birthright citizenship. It hasn’t worked in the past The U.S. is one of more than 30 countries with unrestricted birthright citizenship. Trump said in a recent interview that he plans to revoke the right. Dec. 16, 2024 California is leading the litigation along with New Jersey and Massachusetts, where the lawsuit was filed, Bonta said. Also joining those states and San Francisco as plaintiffs are the states of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin, as well as the District of Columbia. Advertisement The lawsuit is a first for California against the new Trump administration, but likely not the last. The state sued the first Trump administration more than 100 times — often successfully — and Bonta said his office was reviewing other orders by Trump and considering additional litigation. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution — ratified in 1868 — states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” In addition to the 14th Amendment, Bonta noted that the Supreme Court later affirmed the right in 1898, after a San Francisco-born Chinese American named Wong Kim Ark sued to have his own citizenship recognized. Congress also codified birthright citizenship in the Immigration and Nationality Act, the states argue in their lawsuit — which calls Trump’s order an “executive fiat.” Advertisement Children of foreign diplomats are considered a narrow exception to the rule, but children of undocumented immigrants have not historically been excluded. Trump has lambasted birthright citizenship, saying it acts as a magnet for immigrant women to illegally cross into the United States in order to have a child here — and to then use that child’s citizenship as a means of gaining legal status in the country themselves. On the campaign trail, Trump promised that he would immediately end birthright citizenship by advising federal agencies that they had been misinterpreting U.S. law for years.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the chief of the inaugural transition , acknowledged the difficulty of overseeing the handoff of power to Donald Trump in the site where his followers rioted in seeking to overturn election results but also said it was important for herself and other Democrats to acknowledge Trump’s 2024 victory. “We had a job to do,” said Klobuchar, the chairwoman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, which worked for two years on planning the transition, in an interview Monday night. “And that’s why President Obama came and President Clinton, they were well aware of what had happened in that request.

Print Trump signed executive orders Monday declaring that the U.S. government recognizes only two sexes that are “not changeable.” Trump also rescinded three orders on LGBTQ+ rights issued under the Biden administration, including one directing federal agencies to review rules to prevent discrimination based on gender identity. President Trump signed executive orders Monday asserting that the U.S. government recognizes only two sexes that are “not changeable,” and reversing Biden administration directives on LGBTQ+ rights. One of the new orders says that “male” and “female” are defined based on reproductive cells and at the point when a person is conceived, and states that government-issued identification such as passports and visas must reflect that definition. In recent years, the U.S. had begun allowing people to select a third option, X, on passports to indicate an unspecified or other gender identity. Trump’s directive also calls for federal agencies to eliminate any statements or policies “that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology,” which it defines as “an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa.” Federal agencies will enforce “laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes,” the order states, saying such measures were needed to prevent men from gaining access to “intimate single-sex spaces” for women. Advertisement It also directs federal officials to ensure that people  it defines as men are not housed in women’s prisons or detention centers. In addition, the executive order calls for the attorney  general to block the use of federal funding for medical treatment or procedures for gender transition for prisoners. Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research & Policy at Whitman-Walker, an organization focused on LGBTQ+ health equity, noted that the order didn’t appear to make any distinction based on whether someone had pursued medical transition or changed their identity documents. “It seems to be trying to wave a federal policy wand and make transgender people disappear — which is an impossibility,” Baker said. Baker said the changes in detention policies aren’t immediate and must go through the federal process of rulemaking. But if they came to pass, he said, the move could put transgender people in federal custody, particularly transgender women, in serious danger. Under a broader order that rolled back dozens of executive orders issued under then-President  Biden, Trump also reversed orders on LGBTQ+ rights , including one that directed the leaders of federal agencies to review their rules against sex discrimination to ensure that people received equal treatment under the law, “no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.” The Trump administration is likely to face challenges over the executive actions. Kevin Jennings, chief executive of the LGBTQ+ civil rights organization Lambda Legal, said in a statement that many of the changes called for in the executive orders would take time to roll out, but “we will vigilantly monitor and be ready to challenge when they take effect.” Advertisement “We are exploring every legal avenue to challenge these unlawful and unconstitutional actions,” Jennings said. During his campaign, Trump attacked “left-wing gender insanity” and hammered then-Vice President Kamala Harris over the idea of providing gender-affirming care to federal inmates. He said he would push to block the use of federal funds for medical care involved in gender transition, including surgical procedures. Trump also stated that he would seek to terminate healthcare providers from the Medicaid and Medicare programs if they give gender-affirming care to youth, which he refers to as “mutilation” — a move that experts said could cut hospitals and clinics off from critical streams of federal funding. The executive order issued Monday doesn’t broadly address medical care involved in gender transition beyond the restrictions involving prisoners, although experts said changes in how laws about sex discrimination are interpreted could weaken protections for transgender patients. The Biden administration had previously rolled out federal regulations that provided broad protection against discrimination based on gender identity by federally funded healthcare entities. The American Medical Assn. has expressed support for improving access to gender-affirming care, calling it “an important means of improving health outcomes for the transgender population” and said it supports both public and private insurance coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria. The American Psychological Assn. has also opposed ...",

Print On the day he took his oath of office, President Trump promised to sign numerous executive orders that stand to undercut California’s aggressive auto emission standards, undo Biden-era environmental protections and boost U.S. fossil fuel production. To raucous applause — first inside the Capitol Rotunda and inside the Capital One Arena afterward — Trump assured that his administration would “drill baby drill.” Among other anticipated actions, Trump nixed California’s statewide ban on selling new cars that run solely on gasoline starting in 2035. The “Advanced Clean Cars II” rule requires an increasing percentage of passenger vehicles sold by California auto dealerships to be powered by zero-emission electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells, with a small share of plug-in hybrids allowed. It is supposed to take full effect in a decade, though the auto industry is not on track to meet that ambitious goal. “We will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers,” he said in the Capitol Rotunda. “In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.” Trump is an ardent promoter of the fossil fuel industry and outspoken climate change denier. Over the coming weeks, his executive actions have the potential to erase or significantly delay crucial portions of the Golden State’s environmental agenda. Advertisement The impact on California California, the most environmentally minded state in the nation, already is facing dire challenges as a result of global warming. The Los Angeles area is reeling from the most destructive wildfires in American history , which have been burning for nearly two weeks and are not yet fully contained. These natural disasters, according to scientists, have become more difficult to manage as climate change has produced bigger swings between extremely wet and extremely dry conditions . Much of the state is grappling with severe drought and water shortages. Rising seas and powerful storms are endangering the state’s sprawling coastline. “California has ambitious goals and huge risks, as have been highlighted [by the wildfires] the last couple weeks in Los Angeles,” said Cara Horowitz , executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the UCLA School of Law. “It does not have a lot of time — nor do any of us — to tackle climate change. To the extent that the Trump administration and the fights that it provokes slow things down, that’s not great for any of us. It’s certainly not great for achieving California’s ambitious climate goals.” Under the federal Clean Air Act , California is the only state with the authority to establish vehicle emission standards more stringent than federal standards, due to the state’s notoriously poor air quality. But the state must obtain federal approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before the rules can be enforced. Business California bans sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Now the real work begins Plenty of challenges lie ahead as California mandates zero-emission cars, including cost and access to charging. Aug. 25, 2022 The Advanced Clean Cars II rule was expected to prevent 1,287 premature deaths and provide $13 billion in public health benefits over the coming decades, according to the American Lung Assn. In addition, 11 other states have adopted California’s zero-emission regulation, meaning the rule would essentially be in effect for about 133 million people, or nearly 40% of the country’s population. That would change under Trump’s executive order. Environmental organizations, however, vowed to file lawsuits to challenge the order. Advertisement “Trump is attacking the biggest single step ever taken to fight climate pollution,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport campaign. “That’s a victory for his cronies in the oil and auto industries but may well leave his voters with buyer’s remorse. Consumers will pay more at the pump, automakers will lose EV buyers and healthcare costs will go up from people breathing dirtier air. “With the fires in L.A. still smoldering, trying to take away California’s clean car protections is cynical, cruel and illegal. Our kids and everyone with lungs will pay the price for these politically motivated rollbacks of protections for our air and the climate.” California already lags far behind its greenhouse reduction goals due in part to a lack of consistent cooperation from the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency, which did not approve several of the state’s clean-air rules in the waning days of the lame-duck presidency. Without federal approval, California officials shelved plans to enforce ambitious rules t...",

Print Then-President Obama used his executive power to rename the mountain Denali, which is derived from a Native Alaskan language. In his inaugural address, Trump described former President McKinley as a “natural businessman” who made great contributions to the nation. President Trump vowed Monday to revert the name of Alaska’s 20,310-foot Denali, the tallest peak in North America, to Mt. McKinley, reigniting a long-running dispute. “We will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mt. McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs,” Trump said Monday after he was sworn into office at the U.S. Capitol. Trump also said he planned change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and signaled he would sign executive orders to enact the changes during his first day in office. Trump described McKinley, the 25th president,  as “a natural businessman” and hailed the former president for “making our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” McKinley, a Republican, also expanded U.S. territory in the wake of the Spanish-American war. Advertisement A prospector dubbed the peak Mt. McKinley in 1896 as a tribute to William McKinley upon his nomination as a candidate for president — and the name stuck. However, disagreement has dogged the name for decades. In 2015,  then-President Barack Obama used his executive power to redesignate the mountain Denali, a name long championed by Alaskans, which roughly translates to “the great one” in Koyukon Athabascan , a Native Alaskan language. Trump’s pledge to rename Denali was opposed by environmental groups and Alaskan politicians, including Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski. “There is only one name worthy of North America’s tallest mountain: Denali — the Great One,” Murkowski wrote on X after Trump referenced the plan in a speech last month. “Nope! It is Denali!”, Alaska state Sen. Scott Kawaski, a Democrat, wrote alongside a photo of the snow-capped mountain on Bluesky last month. The Sierra Club, a conservation organization, said renaming the peak “goes against the desires of Alaska Natives, Alaska’s elected officials, and centuries of tradition.” Advertisement “The Koyukon people have known this mountain as ‘Denali’ for centuries, and even the state’s elected officials oppose this attempt to rename it,” Athan Manuel, the director of Sierra Club’s Lands Protection Program, said in a statement. “It’s clear that Donald Trump is more interested in culture war stunts than addressing the concerns of the American people.” U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a staunch Trump supporter, said last week that she would direct her staff to draft legislation for the renaming that would make it effective on federal maps and administrative policy, CBS New reported . The debate over the mountain’s name dates back more than 100 years — before the founding of national park where the mountain rises, according to the National Park Service . A team drafting legislation to create a park to protect wildlife disagreed on the name. One hunter-naturalist involved pushed for the park to be called “Mt. Denali National Park” in 1916, referencing a name bestowed to the mountain by native people. The federal government ultimately anointed the towering peak in the Alaska Range “Mt. McKinley” in 1917, honoring the president who held office from 1897 to his assassination in 1901. The park became Mt. McKinley National Park. The debate reemerged in 1975, when the state of Alaska called for the mountain to be called Denali. While the change was blocked for decades, the park in 1980 was renamed Denali National Park and Preserve. More to Read Alaskans say Trump can change Denali’s name but can’t make people call it Mt.

Print One executive order signed by Trump aims to end birthright citizenship. The executive branch has expansive authority over immigration, but many of the president’s orders are certain to face swift legal challenges. WASHINGTON — President Trump took steps Monday to fundamentally and drastically change how the nation handles immigration, signing executive orders to revoke birthright citizenship, declare a national emergency at the southern border and deploy military troops there. Citing public safety and national security threats, Trump said he would immediately halt all illegal entry at the border,  invoking an 18th century law to carry out his plan to rid the country of people here without authorization. “We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people,” Trump said in his inauguration address in the Capitol Rotunda. Advertisement In the months leading up to his election and inauguration, Trump promised to overhaul the immigration system and border security on “Day 1” through executive orders in a sidestep of the regular legislative process. Trump signed the executive orders Monday night, hours after his swearing-in at noon. The executive branch has expansive authority on matters of immigration, but many of the president’s orders are certain to face swift legal challenges. Indeed, the American Civil Liberties Union on Monday filed suit contesting Trump’s order on birthright citizenship. Trump has pledged the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, to be carried out under the direction of Stephen Miller and Tom Homan , architects of his first administration’s zero-tolerance policy that led to thousands of migrant parents being separated from their children. Trump’s attempts will be hampered without substantial additional funding from Congress, where Republicans hold slim majorities. Advertisement Politics Trump immediately flexes presidential powers: 1,500 pardons and a raft of executive orders President Trump flexed his presidential powers Monday, promising executive orders to usher in his agenda. He issued 1,500 pardons, after President Biden issued his own. Jan. 22, 2025 Illegal border crossings have fallen sharply over the last year, with current levels the lowest they’ve been since Trump left office. The emergency declaration allows Trump to unlock federal resources to fund construction of the border wall, as he did in 2019. In June, the Biden administration in effect began blocking most migrants from seeking asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. The restrictions didn’t apply to those who waited for appointments to enter legally at official ports of entry. On Monday, hundreds of asylum seekers learned that use of CBP One, a phone app through which they made the appointments, had ended and their scheduled interviews had been canceled. Tens of thousands of migrants, some of whom had waited more than six months for an interview, are now stranded in Mexico. In recent months, more migrants had entered legally with CBP One appointments than those who were arrested after entering the U.S. illegally. Advertisement Many of the executive orders Trump signed Monday reversed policies enacted by outgoing President Biden. One order dismantled the previous administration’s enforcement priorities that generally limited immigration arrests to recent border-crossers, serious criminals and other national security threats. Another dissolves an interagency task force Biden established to reunite families separated by Trump’s zero-tolerance policy. As of April, more 1,400 children remained separated, according to a federal report on the task force’s progress . “As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,” Trump said. “We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.” Homan, who serves as Trump’s “border czar,” has said the new administration will continue to target immigrants with criminal records. But the new, broad rules could subject most people in the U.S. illegally to detention and deportation, laying the foundation for more so-called collateral arrests of undocumented immigrants who aren’t criminals during enforcement operations. Another order ends humanitarian programs — vastly expanded by Biden — that gave temporary legal status and work authorization to more than 1.5 million people.

Print WASHINGTON — President Trump promised an inaugural address focused on “unity,” but what he delivered was more a campaign speech in a formal suit — long on promises and anger toward opponents , short on gestures toward national reconciliation. “For American citizens , Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day,” he said — meaning liberation from a Democratic administration that (in his telling) “extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken.” “From this moment on, American decline is over,” he promised. And he hinted darkly at what was behind his criminal prosecutions and two assassination attempts. “Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.” Advertisement Parts of Trump’s speech closely echoed his 2017 inaugural address — the one that dwelled on “American carnage.” To be fair, the new president offered a hopeful vision as well — embodied in the promises he made during his campaign. Politics Column: I watched Trump’s inauguration with a Democrat and a Republican. Here’s what they saw Two friends, a Democrat and Republican, watch Trump’s inauguration and speech with different perspectives and some good-natured ribbing. They both praise his delivery, if not his policies. Jan. 20, 2025 “The golden age of America begins right now,” he said. And for voters already persuaded that Trump will make America great again, it was an inspiring list. He promised not only to halt inflation, but also to reduce prices; increase manufacturing jobs and take automobile production to record highs; and end illegal immigration quickly and completely. Advertisement And to give his administration a dramatic start, he said that he would sign dozens of executive orders, including decrees to prohibit migrants from applying for asylum, end “birthright citizenship,” open more federal lands and waters to drilling for oil and gas, and declare that the federal government will recognize “only two sexes — male and female” — on official documents. He also promised — officially, this time — to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” Some of the orders are certain to be challenged in court. Others will be largely symbolic. But they appeared intended to convey an image of unstoppable momentum. Advertisement With his inauguration, a second speech in the Capitol — in which he called one critic “a crying lunatic” and another “guilty as hell” — and a flurry of executive orders, the first day of his second term confirmed  there is no Trump 2.0. But there may be a Trump 1.5, better organized than the chaotic Trump of his first term. Politics Scenes from a packed Rotunda: Moguls, former presidents — and some notable absences Hundreds of the world’s most powerful people — among them every living president as well as billionaire tech executives — were crammed cheek-by-jowl in the 7,200-square-foot Capitol Rotunda. Jan. 20, 2025 What Trump meant by “unity,” it turned out, is not bipartisanship, but uniform support behind the policies and goals he campaigned for. “My recent election is a mandate,” he said. “As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda.” Politics Trump immediately flexes presidential powers: 1,500 pardons and a raft of executive orders President Trump flexed his presidential powers Monday, promising executive orders to usher in his agenda. He issued 1,500 pardons, after President Biden issued his own. Jan. 22, 2025 But that’s just a hopeful bit of salesmanship. Yes, he won the popular vote, although he fell just short of 50%. But a string of public opinion polls has shown that public support for Trump’s policies — the normal meaning of “mandate” — is not as robust as he claimed. An Associated Press poll this month found that although 8 in 10 American adults support Trump’s goal of deporting undocumented immigrants who are guilty of violent crimes, fewer than half back deporting anyone else. Only 3 in 10 agree with Trump’s proposal to end birthright citizenship, guaranteed in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.

Print MEXICO CITY — President Trump said Monday that the United States would reassert control over the Panama Canal , the strategic, U.S.-built waterway that Washington handed over to the Panamanian government more than a quarter-century ago. “We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back,” Trump declared in his inaugural address. The president accused the Panamanian government of ignoring U.S. interests, overcharging U.S. ships — including U.S. Navy vessels — and, in effect, turning the vital maritime passage connecting the Pacific and Caribbean oceans over to China. “China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn’t give it to China,” Trump charged. Advertisement In reaction to Trump, Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino rejected the idea of his country giving up control of the canal, which is  among the globe’s iconic ocean passages and a signature source of national pride and revenue for the Central American nation. World & Nation Trump threatens to try to take back the Panama Canal. Panama’s president balks at the suggestion Donald Trump is suggesting that his new administration could try to regain control of the Panama Canal. Dec. 22, 2024 “The Canal is and will continue to be under Panamanian control,” Mulino said in a statement, repeating comments he made last month after Trump floated the idea of retaking control of the canal. And, in a repudiation of Trump’s charge that China runs the canal, Mulino denied that any country except Panama directed operations. “No nation in the world interferes with our administration,” said Mulino, who said dialogue was the appropriate way to deal with any disputes. A Hong Kong-based consortium controls two ports on either end of the canal. Advertisement Trump provided no details on how the United States planned to go about reasserting control over territory and infrastructure that are part of sovereign Panamanian land — territory that the country’s leadership has vowed not to relinquish. World & Nation A history of the Panama Canal — and why Trump can’t take it back on his own President-elect Donald Trump is decrying the increased fees Panama has imposed to use the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Dec. 24, 2024 “We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama’s promise to us has been broken,” Trump said. “The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.” The United States handed control of the canal over to Panama in December 1999 after a period of joint-administration that followed U.S.-Panamanian accords signed in 1977. While some U.S. critics assailed the turnover as a betrayal, many supporters in both the United States and Latin America hailed the move as a historic and positive step in the history of the Americas. Advertisement The 51-mile-long canal avoids the need for ships to make the much longer voyage around Cape Horn at the tip of South America. Considered one of the world’s monumental engineering feats, the canal opened in 1914 after years of construction that involved clearing out miles of malarial jungles, blasting through mountains and the erection of complex locks across the Isthmus of Panama. Thousands of laborers, many from Caribbean nations, perished in the massive canal project.

Print President Trump wasted no time Monday initiating the conservative agenda he’d promised on the campaign trail, signing a slate of executive orders and issuing pardons for Jan. 6 insurrectionists. President Biden issued several pardons on his way out too, including for House members who had investigated the Jan. 6 attack. Liberal leaders and advocacy organizations said they were assessing Trump’s orders and preparing challenges. President Trump quickly flexed the sweeping powers of the presidency following his second inauguration at the Capitol on Monday, signing a slate of executive orders that would radically alter U.S. policy if allowed to stand. He also pardoned or commuted the sentences of all of his loyalists — more than 1,500 people — who stormed the same Capitol building in a failed attempt to illegitimately keep him in power four years prior, repeatedly referring to them as “hostages.” “We hope they come out tonight, frankly,” Trump said during an evening signing ceremony at the Oval Office — a reference to the fact that many of those defendants were in prison for serious offenses such as assaulting police officers. Advertisement Trump’s orders reflected an aggressive start to the conservative agenda he promised on the campaign trail, aimed at reining in illegal immigration, strengthening U.S. manufacturing and the broader economy, rolling back LGBTQ+ rights, reinforcing American dominance abroad and bending the sprawling federal bureaucracy to his will. At an evening rally in Washington, D.C., that was held in lieu of an outdoor parade because of frigid temperatures, Trump sat at a desk and used black markers to sign nine orders. The first, he said, undid about 80 “destructive, radical actions” made by President Biden — having to do with issues including immigration, the COVID-19 pandemic, voting rights, “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives, protections for LGBTQ+ people, the operation of prisons by private entities, tackling climate change and other environmental protections. Advertisement The other orders withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and informed the United Nations of that decision; placed freezes on new federal regulations and most federal hiring while his administration gets into place; mandated federal workers return to in-person work full time; and sent directives to federal agencies to protect free speech, end the “weaponization of government” for political purposes, and find ways to decrease inflation and high costs for average Americans. Trump said he also would later sign other orders — such as one mandating that agencies preserve all records pertaining to his own prosecution on various federal charges under the Biden administration. And he renewed campaign promises to take other actions, such as ending federal taxes on tipped wages. Trump concluded the event by tossing the markers he’d used to sign the orders into the crowd, to big cheers from his supporters. Advertisement Soon after, Trump was back in the Oval Office signing more orders and the pardons. One order announced the withdrawal of the U.S. from the World Health Organization, while another purported to end the long-established constitutional guarantee of U.S. citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents’ immigration status. Trump commuted the sentences of 14 people — including some of the highest-profile Jan. 6 defendants — to time served, and granted full pardons to everyone else convicted of offenses from that day. The Justice Department recently estimated that it had charged more than 1,500 people, including 590 with assaulting, resisting, impeding or obstructing law enforcement. As of November, nearly 1,000 had pleaded guilty, more than 200 had been found guilty at trial, and more than 600 had been sentenced to time behind bars. Trump’s pardons followed a last-minute decision by  Biden to flex the same power on his way out of the White House by pardoning members of Congress and their staffers who had investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, as well as other former U.S. officials who have drawn Trump’s ire for having challenged his authority in the past.

Hundreds of the world’s most powerful people — among them every living former U.S. president as well as billionaire tech executives — crammed cheek-by-jowl in the 7,200-square-foot space after the ceremony was moved indoors because of a bitter cold snap, one that prevented the inauguration from taking place outside on the West Front of the Capitol for the first time in four decades.

Former First Lady Laura Bush sat between Bush and Obama. There were some notable absences — former First Lady Michelle Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) and former Second Lady Karen Pence , who notably snubbed Trump at former President Carter’s state funeral on Jan. 9. Advertisement Her husband, Mike Pence, who served as Trump’s vice president in his first term and whom insurrectionists chanted about killing during the Jan. 6, 2021, effort to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss, attended, as did former Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn. Pence previously stated that Trump’s “reckless words” on Jan. 6 endangered everyone at the Capitol that day, including him and his family. The former president and reelected president responded by calling Pence “delusional.” Dignitaries gathered at the neoclassical site where Trump took the oath of office Monday. It was also the site his supporters had stormed as they sought to stop the certification of the 2020 election. Advertisement Democratic Sen.

The presence of so many presidents and vice presidents here today is truly a testament to that endurance.” She spoke in front of roughly 600 people beneath the Rotunda’s grand dome, who were crammed tightly together in folding chairs that appeared more reminiscent of a high school graduation than an inauguration ceremony. Trump’s Cabinet appointees received less choice seating than billionaire backers such as Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.

Cancellation of the program was one of several tough measures announced by the Trump administration to curb immigration. MEXICO CITY — Among the first on-the-ground effects of President Trump’s sweeping immigration revisions was visible Monday on the Mexican side of U.S. ports of entry, where hundreds of disconsolate asylum applicants were stunned to learn of the cancellation of a program aimed at easing the process of applying for asylum . Many lined up early Monday, the day of Trump’s inauguration, at the ports of entry for scheduled interviews with U.S. inspectors — only to hear that their interviews had been canceled and that the cellphone application program, known as CPB One, had ended. The demise of CBP One leaves tens of thousands of migrants stranded in Mexico without potential legal pathways to enter the United States. Some have waited six months or more for their CBP One interviews. Many others were in the queue awaiting appointments. Advertisement “We don’t know what we are going to do,” said a distraught Aliana Armenta, 22, from Cuba, speaking from the Mexican side of the border bridge that spans the Rio Grande between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso. She, her husband, Fidel Jiménez, 23, and the couple’s 1-month-old daughter, Karla,  had a CBP One interview scheduled for Monday in El Paso. The family arrived at 5 a.m. on the Mexican side of the bridge to learn, along with other prospective asylum-seekers, that the app had been canceled, their hopes dashed. “Maybe we will go back to Mexico City,” mused Jiménez, noting that they had waited in the Mexican capital for months for confirmation of their CBP One interview. “We really don’t know.” Advertisement Hundreds of others bared their disappointments at crossing points along the border. Some cried and hugged upon learning of CBP One’s cancellation. CPB One was originally developed to help prevent backups of travelers entering the country legally. After downloading it to their phones and entering their passport information, foreign nationals could use the application to smooth their way through border crossings and airports.

Jan. 20, 2025 In 2023, the Biden administration expanded use of the app in a bid to help bring order to a crush of asylum-seekers arriving at the Southwest border. CBP One has since facilitated the entry of almost 1 million people, mostly prospective asylum-seekers, into the United States via ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border. The vast majority were given notices to appear in U.S. immigration courts for adjudication of their cases. The Biden administration lauded the app as part of the solution to the border crisis. Immigrant advocates complained that CBP One was glitch-prone and reduced the right of asylum to a lottery. Trump and Republican leaders denounced the app, saying it amounted to an “open borders” policy that encouraged more migrants to head for the United States without proper vetting for criminal histories. The cancellation of the program was one of several immigration-related measures announced Monday. At his swearing-in ceremony in Washington, Trump said he would declare a national emergency at the southern border and sign executive orders to combat illegal immigration. Advertisement In addition, Trump said he planned to reinstate Remain in Mexico, a controversial program launched in his first administration — and ended by Biden — that forced asylum-seekers arriving at the Southwest border to await U.S. immigration court dates in Mexico. Critics called Remain in Mexico inhumane and a boon for drug cartels preying on stranded migrants, but supporters said it was an effective deterrent to bogus asylum claims.

Print The 2024 presidential election painted a dismal picture — a country split red and blue, a near-even divide, reminding us how fractured we’ve become. Despite this polarization, nearly three-quarters of Americans agree on one thing: Our democracy is under threat. In these respects, today’s America resembles the America of 1776, when divisions threatened the future of the democratic experiment. As patriots readied for battle and loyalists clung to the British crown, Thomas Paine published “ Common Sense ,” a fiercely persuasive pamphlet that united Colonists to fight against monarchy in the name of self-rule. “It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies,” Paine argued. To that end, he turned democratic ideals into a shared purpose. America, bound to the will of its people, challenged a world bound to the will of kings. And with “Common Sense,” Paine joined Americans together in the bold belief that “we have it in our power to begin the world over again.” Advertisement Soon, Paine’s pamphlet was everywhere — whispered by soldiers in Valley Forge tents, shouted in Philadelphia taverns, quoted in sermons. With half a million copies sold by the end of the American Revolution, “Common Sense” remains one of the best-selling works of all time relative to the U.S. population (2.5 million in 1776, not counting slaves and Native Americans). If not for “Common Sense,” the United States might not exist as we know it. Now, nearly 250 years later, Paine’s pamphlet stands not just as a relic of history but as a blueprint for preserving democracy. From challenging authoritarian rule to limiting the sway of the wealthy to upholding the will of the majority, Paine’s words are more relevant now than ever. And his message was clear: We must unite to confront the forces that threaten the republic — starting with the threat of absolute power. Advertisement Paine’s critique of unchecked authority was central to his argument for a government of, by and for the people. He saw King George III’s rule as the epitome of tyranny, and warned that “a thirst for absolute power is the natural disease of monarchy.” That warning resonates as Donald Trump returns to office with a well-documented record of testing and stretching the limits of power. In July, as Trump’s efforts led the Supreme Court to expand presidential immunity, Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent echoed Paine’s concerns. She wrote, “In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law ” — a deep departure from the assertion in “Common Sense” that “in America, the law is king … and there ought to be no other.” But Paine’s concerns extended beyond authoritarian leaders. “Common Sense” also decried the outsized influence of the wealthy. With frequent condemnations of “aristocratical tyranny,” Paine scrutinized the rich as “slaves to fear” and alleged that “their minds are early poisoned by importance.” Paine believed American democracy could not survive if power was bought and sold by the wealthy elite. And, again, his warnings apply today. Advertisement Supreme Court rulings such as Citizens United , the decision that unleashed unlimited election spending by corporations and individuals, have turned Paine’s fears into our reality. The 2024 elections saw a staggering $16 billion in campaign expenditures — with money coming from small donors but also super PACs and at least 150 billionaire families . With Republicans and Democrats capitalizing on almost unchecked spending, both parties are complicit in a system in which influence can be bought by the highest bidder. Paine’s rebuke of kings and aristocrats was grounded in a democratic bulwark: fair representation. Amid Colonial protests against unjust taxes, the cry “no taxation without representation” lit a rebellious spark. Then “Common Sense” set it ablaze, insisting that “there is no political matter which more deserves our attention” than “large and equal representation” — a demand unmet by America’s rulers across the sea. Centuries later, as policies drift farther from majority views, Americans are confronting a new ocean. Not one measured in miles but in understanding, and just as vast. The fall of Roe vs. Wade disregarded the will of 63% of Americans who support access to abortion in “all or most cases,” according to the Pew Research Center .

Print The ceremony was moved into the Capitol Rotunda because of subfreezing temperatures forecast for Washington. Trump is expected to begin his first hours in office by signing a slew of executive orders, including many aimed at tightening rules on immigration and possibly initiating a mass deportation. WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump took the oath of office to become the 47th president of the United States on Monday, capping a remarkable political comeback that he said would enable him “to make America greater, stronger and far more exceptional than ever before.” The man who served as the 45th president painted a dark portrait of the challenges facing the country without his leadership and said he had overcome many obstacles — including an assassination attempt — because he had been “saved by God to make America great again.” Trump became only the second person in the nation’s nearly 250-year history to regain the White House after losing it — following Grover Cleveland, the first Democrat to become president after the Civil War and the last to hold the post before the dawn of the 20th century. Advertisement The Republican’s ascension to the most powerful office in the world represented an astounding resurrection for a man twice impeached during his first term, then held liable for both civil and criminal misconduct during the years he tried to regain the White House. He has become the first convicted felon to serve as president. The former businessman and reality TV star returns to the White House this week with an approval rating above 50%, marking his best showing in the polls since his unexpected and divisive rise to power in 2016. Organizers of the ceremony, driven indoors by frigid temperatures, chose the theme “Our Enduring Democracy,” an ideal that had been challenged four years ago, when Trump refused to attend the inauguration or accept that former Vice President Joe Biden had defeated him. Advertisement Every living former president attended Monday’s event — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. They were joined by world leaders including former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Argentine President Javier Milei. The chief executives of Meta, X and Amazon sat in front of the president-elect’s entire Cabinet — a nod to the importance Trump has given the heads of some of the most powerful companies and social media platforms. Also occupying prime seats were conservative business and political  figures, including SpaceX and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk , ultimate fighting impresario Dana White and Joe Rogan, the online commentator. Advertisement Trump spoke for nearly 30 minutes to the inaugural gathering, a nationwide audience and supporters who were forced to gather in Capital One Arena in Washington after the planned outdoor ceremony was canceled. Sticking almost entirely to his prepared remarks , the president ranged widely in his tone — from recriminations about his purported mistreatment by Biden and others, to a pledge to take unprecedented measures at the U.S. Mexico border “to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,” to loftier pledges centered on restoring America’s “manifest destiny” to lead the world. The address began with Trump returning to a theme of American exceptionalism that he unveiled in 2015, when he began his first presidential campaign. Politics Trump made many ‘Day 1’ promises. Will he make good on them? President-elect Donald Trump could start taking action Monday on his many “Day 1” campaign promises, but California officials and others are ready to fight. Jan. 17, 2025 “The Golden Age of America begins right now,” he said. “From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer during every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first.” At 78 years and 220 days, Trump is the oldest individual to become U.S. president , surpassing Biden, who had been just a couple of months past 78 when he took the oath of office in 2021. The Republican president, who will benefit from having GOP majorities in both the House and Senate, said his leadership was needed at a time the Democrats had led the country badly astray. “As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust,” Trump said. “For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.” ...",

Print Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called the Food and Drug Administration a “corrupt system” that is waging “war on public health.” He has pledged to eliminate “entire departments” at the agency charged with ensuring the safety of the foods Americans eat and the medicines we take, warning the more than 18,000 people who work there to “pack your bags.” President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Kennedy to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If he is confirmed by the Senate , Kennedy will have the opportunity to “go wild” on health, foods and medicines, as Trump put it during the campaign. Science & Medicine Why RFK Jr. nomination sets off alarms among many public health specialists The anti-vaccine activist could oversee the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. Nov. 16, 2024 Remaking the FDA may not be as straightforward — or as desirable — as it seems from the outside, says Dr. Robert Califf . He’s in a position to know: his second stint as the agency’s commissioner comes to an end Monday. Advertisement Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf testifies during a Senate hearing on Capitol Hill. (Jose Luis Magana / Associated Press) Califf’s career has spanned academia, large health systems, the biotech industry, Silicon Valley and the highest echelons of the federal government. His colleagues at the FDA “work just as hard and are at least as smart” as people he’s worked with anywhere else, he said. Public criticism comes with the territory , but things look different when you’re on the inside trying to ensure access to infant formula , make tobacco products less addictive and help consumers understand what’s in their groceries . Califf spoke to a group of reporters last week on his last day in the FDA’s White Oak campus in Silver Spring, Md. Here’s his advice to those who will take over public health roles in the incoming Trump administration. His comments have been edited for length and clarity. What do you wish people understood about your job? This is a job that has a lot of bosses and a lot of constraints. When you’re in the commissioner’s office at FDA, you report to the executive branch. But Congress also thinks it’s your boss. It’s not unheard of for FDA to want to do something and get a message from an important appropriator that, “If you do this, we’re going to cut your budget somewhere else.” Advertisement It’s really interesting to me that people think the FDA can just declare this and that. It usually can’t. It usually has to go through a systematic approach. The minute you step beyond the legal boundaries of what the rule book says, you’re going to end up in court. That will get reined in fairly quickly. Science & Medicine The FDA knew long ago that red dye No. 3 causes cancer. Why did it take so long to ban it? The FDA banned the use of red dye No. 3 in foods and medicines sold in the U.S. because it has been shown to cause cancer in rats. The action highlights the limits of a federal law known as the Delaney clause. Jan. 15, 2025 How do you expect the new administration to change the FDA? I have no idea. Right now we have rhetoric , and the rhetoric is contradictory. We just have to wait and see. Some of the people who have been nominated to positions have been very critical, implying that there are nefarious motives of people working in public health agencies. It feels a lot different when you have to make the decision and be accountable for it as opposed to criticizing the decision. Advertisement I have a copy of [President Theodore] Roosevelt’s “Man in the Arena” speech above my desk at home to remind myself every day that you get all this criticism from people who are not actually doing the work. It’s better to be in the arena trying to do the best that you can do. Kennedy says he wants to get rid of certain departments within FDA. Are there areas you’re most worried about? I’m worried about every part of the FDA. I don’t think you’ll find people at FDA doing work that no one cares about. If you look at the food side of the FDA and the inspectorate, it’s massively underfunded. If you cut that — especially if you’re also saying we need to radically change the food system — that would be a problem. Science & Medicine How the FDA allows companies to add secret ingredients to our food The FDA allows food makers to vouch for the safety of ingredients they add to our food, calling them ‘generally recognized as safe.’ Dec. 4, 2024 Kennedy wants to see big changes in the food and health industries. Is that realistic? Slogans are easy, and the...",

By late afternoon, an exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees had begun. Three hostages were handed over to Israeli forces — the first of 33 expected to be freed over the next six weeks in exchange for some 1,900 Palestinians. Israeli authorities were assembling the first 90 at Ofer prison in the West Bank, but by early morning Monday they still had not been freed. Advertisement The deal follows months of tortuous negotiations led by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, with the Qataris regularly expressing frustration and threatening to walk away at one point. The precariousness of the deal was highlighted even before the fighting stopped. The cease-fire had been set for 8:30 a.m. local time, with plans for three female hostages to be exchanged for dozens of Palestinian prisoners later in the day. But in the hours ahead of the deadline, Hamas failed to send the list of hostage names, prompting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to say there would be no cease-fire unless the information was received. Hamas blamed “technical field issues” for the delay and said it was still committed to the deal.

At 11:15 a.m., the cease-fire came into effect. Rescue services in Gaza said 19 people were killed during the delay. Despite the shaky start, the cease-fire held throughout Sunday, allowing the first detainee exchange to begin around 4:30 p.m. local time.

World leaders “know they have to plan for all contingencies,” said one analyst. But with Trump’s expansionist dreams, growing relationships with populists and Elon Musk’s weighing in on Europe, the world will have to wait to see what the next four years bring. WASHINGTON — As Donald Trump takes the oath of office Monday for the second time, the world is watching with a mix of fascination, curiosity, elation or dread — and a sense that this time around, those outside the United States perhaps have a better idea of what to expect from his presidency. Even before Inauguration Day, the 2½ months of transition since Trump defeated his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, had already yielded head-spinning developments on the global scene. Some of America’s closest traditional allies were jolted by the president-elect’s rhetoric evoking an expansionist 19th century ethos, delivered via modern-day social media blast. Populist figures, already emboldened by a tidal wave of anti-establishment electoral sentiment, have found a congenial reception in Trump’s orbit. Advertisement And autocratic governments are anticipating a far more transactional relationship with Washington, unburdened by diplomatic discourse about human rights or the rule of law. Trump may be the most mercurial American president in decades, but embedded in that is a certain element of predictability: that nearly any long-standing international norm may well fall by the wayside. The keenly felt fragility of a post-World War II rules-based order is its own kind of road map, some veteran observers suggest. Many foreign leaders “are no longer scrambling to figure out what to do,” said Daniel Fried, who spent nearly four decades as a U.S. Foreign Service officer. Advertisement World & Nation News Analysis: Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin: A much-scrutinized relationship is back in the spotlight President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin share some traits and want some of the same things. But a chasm divides them. Nov. 27, 2024 “They know they have to plan for all contingencies,” said Fried, now with the Atlantic Council think tank. “They have a better sense this time, though it still rattles them.” Trump’s heavy footfall in the final days before assuming office almost certainly brought about the finalization of a cease-fire and hostage-release agreement in the devastating war in the Gaza Strip. The deal drafted by the Biden administration  took effect the day before Trump’s swearing-in. Though Trump has backed off on a boast that he would halt the fighting in Ukraine in 24 hours, there is a sense among all involved parties that Trump’s presidency will alter the trajectory of the nearly three-year-old full-scale Russian invasion of its sovereign neighbor. Advertisement Then there’s China. The upheaval triggered by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the immensely popular short- video app TikTok must sever ties with its Chinese parent company or face a U.S. ban will likely surface some insights into future dealings by Washington and Beijing over accelerating technological, trade and military rivalries. “China could be a big surprise” under Trump, said Michael Cox, an emeritus professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. One factor to watch closely, he said, were the “huge” business interests in China of the world’s wealthiest man, Elon Musk, a prominent but relatively new figure in Trump’s orbit. World & Nation Analysis: Europe, too, feels Musk’s political impact. How far will it go?

Print Unlike the many people who are upset that Donald Trump is being inaugurated on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I see it as a good thing. First, it calls even more attention to the day and its significance. Second, it is a chance to speculate about what King might say and do if he were alive in the Trump era. Counterfactual, “what if” history is a trend in the literary world. Trump’s inauguration on the holiday may prompt us to think about what America and the world might have looked like with King alive and well. Conversely, how did America and the world devolve without him? King was the kind of leader who comes along once in a lifetime, one with unmatched eloquence and passion. His gift for oratory could energize all kinds of people, including workers, presidents and other heads of state. He possessed visionary insight on the complex racial, social and economic ills as well as their solutions and consequences. Advertisement Politics Trump arrives in Washington for inaugural celebrations to mark his return to power Donald Trump returns to Washington to celebrate with family, supporters and political allies ahead of his second inauguration. Jan. 18, 2025 He worked tirelessly to build a grassroots civil rights and social justice movement and serve as its guiding force. And his charismatic presence influenced people to act on the issues and problems he was working to solve. How might that play out in the Trump era? To begin with, King abhorred all violence. He most likely would have been deeply pained by the mass gun killings that have become somewhat commonplace in American cities. He would almost certainly have butted heads with the National Rifle Assn. and its ardent backer Trump while lobbying Congress to pass comprehensive gun control legislation. When it comes to international politics, King surely would have condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine. One can also envision him speaking out against Hamas’ kidnapping and slaughter of Israelis as well as Israel’s killing of Palestinian civilians. He would have called these wars ineffectual, repressive and wasteful, a drain on resources that should go to programs that aid the poor and minorities. On this point, he and Trump, who repeatedly claims he has kept America out of wasteful wars, would likely be in some agreement. Advertisement Politics Trump made many ‘Day 1’ promises. Will he make good on them? President-elect Donald Trump could start taking action Monday on his many “Day 1” campaign promises, but California officials and others are ready to fight. Jan. 17, 2025 It’s impossible to imagine King not fighting tooth and nail against the rash of voter suppression laws and the GOP’s ploys to dilute Black and minority voting strength, including the assault on the Voting Rights Act. He’d bump heads with Trump on that. But Trump would also have a comeback: He’d cite the sharp increase in Black and Hispanic votes for him in the recent presidential election. King would almost certainly try to prevent the country’s Republican-led rightward sprint, drawing negative attention from Trump and his MAGA coalition. But even he would not have been able to stop the many powerful forces with vested interest in halting or reversing the country’s momentum toward expanded civil rights, labor protections and economic fairness. The resurgence of overtly racist sentiments, acts and conflicts under Trump would obviously trouble King, who famously hoped for a day when Americans are judged “not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” Advertisement King would have had to find new ways to challenge the continuing ills of poverty and wealth inequality, which ballooned in the decades after his death. Even given his superb organizing and planning skills, this growth likely would have been a losing battle. Had he lived, King’s unshakable commitment to the cause of human rights and economic equality surely would not have diminished. Wherever there was a campaign, march, rally, lobbying effort or event that his presence could boost, it’s a safe bet that he’d have much to say and do. In the Trump era, there would be plenty to keep him busy. Earl Ofari Hutchinson’s latest book is “Day 1 The Trump Reign.” His commentaries can be found at thehutchinsonreport.net .

Print Our survey of presidential experts a year ago drew attention for ranking Joe Biden 14th among the presidents, ahead of such consequential chief executives as Woodrow Wilson and Ronald Reagan. At the time, many expressed surprise, if not skepticism, that the third edition of our Presidential Greatness Project had put Biden in the top third of the nation’s presidents. True, President Biden helped lead the nation out of the COVID-19 pandemic while presiding over a series of legislative achievements, and many gave him credit for restoring important norms to the Oval Office after the tumultuous term of Donald Trump, whom the experts ranked last. But the story was unfinished, and the verdict was preliminary. In the months following the release of our survey, voters and experts alike learned much more about Biden’s decline with age, laid bare especially by his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June. Weeks later, Biden dropped out of the race, handing the reins to Vice President Kamala Harris , who would go on to be decisively defeated by Trump. Advertisement Opinion Opinion: We know how voters feel about Trump and Biden. But how do the experts rank their presidencies? This Presidents Day, Trumpism is affecting assessments of Obama, Reagan and others. Today’s politics have also diminished the likes of Jackson and Wilson. Feb. 18, 2024 Even as Biden’s administration shifted its focus to his legacy in the months since he dropped out of the race, his presidency grew more fraught. Evidence of his diminished capacity accumulated; he pardoned his son Hunter, undermining his claims to restoring upright adherence to the rule of law; and Trump and his fellow Republicans prepared to return to power and reverse much of what Biden accomplished. Presidential legacies are a quintessentially American phenomenon; it seems that from the moment a president steps off the inaugural dais, chatter about their prospective legacy and the impact of this event or that decision begins. Those legacies remain contested well after they leave office, sometimes for many decades: Consider the continuing reassessment of presidents such as Wilson, Andrew Jackson and Ulysses S. Grant, all of whom have been out of office for well over a century. Presidents themselves are quite aware of this. Barack Obama once observed that he and his presidential predecessors were all part of America’s long-running story and that each president just tries to get their particular paragraph right. Of course, presidents don’t write their paragraphs alone. Journalists, historians and the allies and enemies of individual presidents play significant roles in the way each is remembered and regarded. Advertisement Opinion Opinion: With Trump mulling a running mate, we had experts rank vice presidents from first to worst Scholars rated the performance of the past century of veeps. Joe Biden and Al Gore scored high. Kamala Harris and Mike Pence, not so much. July 7, 2024 Advocates of a particular president often point to the substantive accomplishments of an administration as evidence of a great legacy. Biden’s defenders, for example, argue that the American Rescue Plan, the infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act make him a momentous president, at least in the domestic sphere. But for each of those successes, there are blemishes such as Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, his struggle with inflation and the chaotic situation at the southern border. The reality is that while most modern presidents can lay claim to significant policy successes, most of those initiatives don’t end up being the most significant parts of history’s narrative about them. Legacies are just as much about the presidents’ political performance, their relationship with the American people, the success of their parties and the historical memory of what it was like during their time in office — the presidential vibes, as our students might say. When we reflect on the ways presidents are remembered, more often than not their greatest policy achievements aren’t at the forefront. Gerald Ford is best remembered not for his administration’s fight against inflation or for signing campaign finance reforms but for pardoning his predecessor, Richard Nixon. Jimmy Carter’s presidency is more often defined by his malaise speech than by the 13 days he spent at Camp David negotiating a durable peace between Israel and Egypt.

Print For 236 years, ever since George Washington, a newly elected president’s inaugural address usually aimed to unify the country. Until Donald Trump, that is. The safe bet is that the man who shows up Monday will be the divisive Trump who calls his foes “vermin.” But he could, if he wanted, strike a different note. WASHINGTON — For 236 years, ever since George Washington, a newly elected president’s inaugural address has traditionally served several purposes. One is simply to mark the beginning of a new administration in celebration and hope — and an occasional dose of eloquence . Another, equally important, is to try to unify the country as far as possible after the rancor of a divisive election campaign. Advertisement It shouldn’t be a campaign speech; the time for campaigning is over. It isn’t a list of programs and policies; later speeches like the State of the Union are made for that. “You want to aim at unifying the country — because if you don’t do that, you’re just the people who won and the people who lost,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania, co-author of two books on presidential speechmaking. “An inaugural address should focus on the things we have in common, not everything that divides us,” she said. “You want to see a president who is going to be for you even if you didn’t vote for him.” Advertisement That has been the basic model since Washington delivered the first, in New York in 1789. Until Donald Trump , that is. When Trump began his first term as president in 2017 he offered a few head-fakes toward unity. “We are one nation,” he allowed. But he spent more of his speech attacking politicians in both parties who had opposed him. And he painted the United States as a crime-ridden hellscape of “rusted-out factories, scattered like tombstones.” Advertisement “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” he promised. Opinion Opinion: Trump’s inauguration speech makes it clear: He meant every word he said during the campaign Before Donald Trump’s inaugural address Friday, the key question was what tone he would choose to launch his presidency. Jan. 20, 2017 Politics Analysis: Raw, angry and aggrieved, President Trump’s inaugural speech does little to heal political wounds There was no pivot. Jan. 20, 2017 One of his Republican predecessors, George W. Bush, offered a succinct evaluation afterward: “That was some weird s—,”  he told Hillary Clinton, who sat next to him at the ceremony. Trump’s divisive tone was deliberate. “We didn’t win an election to bring the country together,” said his advisor  Stephen K. Bannon, who helped write the speech. The goal was to “take on the elites … with a blowtorch.” On Monday, Trump is scheduled to launch his second four-year term with another inaugural address. He promises that this time will be different. Politics Trump made many ‘Day 1’ promises. Will he make good on them? President-elect Donald Trump could start taking action Monday on his many “Day 1” campaign promises, but California officials and others are ready to fight. Jan. 17, 2025 “It’s going to be a message of unity,” he said last month. “No American carnage.” For the record: 6:17 p.m. Jan. 19, 2025 An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that at the Republican National Convention in August, Trump aides forecast that the former president would present a new, more contemplative persona. The convention was in July. That would be a pleasant surprise. After all, we’ve seen this movie before, and it turned out to be a bait-and-switch. At the Republican National Convention in July, Trump aides forecast that the former president, who had narrowly escaped death in an assassination attempt days before, would present a new, more contemplative persona — a “softer version,” his daughter-in-law Lara Trump suggested. That kinder, gentler Trump lasted about 20 minutes . At the beginning of his acceptance speech, New Trump urged both sides to not “demonize political disagreement.” A few minutes later, Old Trump reappeared and demonized “crazy Nancy Pelosi” for “destroying our country.” World & Nation Column: We were promised a ‘softer’ Donald Trump. What we got was a fully Trumpified Republican Party The Republican convention’s lesson was that there is no New Trump — only one committed to cementing the MAGA transformation of the GOP for generations. July 19, 2024 To be fair, it was the middle of a hard-fought campaign — one in which Trump also called Democrats “vermin” and accused immigrants of “poisoning the blood of our country.” Advertisement Now, however, Tr...",

Print House Speaker Mike Johnson has thwarted the installation of a plaque, approved by Congress, honoring officers who protected the Capitol. It is vital that partisans aren’t allowed to whitewash history simply because it makes some people uncomfortable. On Monday, Donald Trump will visit the scene of a crime, laying his hand on a Bible and vowing to preserve and protect the Constitution as he swears a formal oath to become the nation’s 47th president. The bloodstains of the Jan. 6 insurrection have long ago washed away. The shattered windows of the Capitol are mended, the broken doors replaced. You’d never know the terrible mayhem that was visited on the seat of our national government, or the way our country and democracy were defiled that pitch-black day. Which is exactly how some would like it. Trump and his acolytes have spent years rewriting history and burying the uncomfortable truth — the lies about a stolen 2020 election , the violent attempt to overturn the result — beneath a reeking blanket of deception, misinformation and falsity . Advertisement The attempted cover-up is so total it extends even to the physical premises, where House Speaker Mike Johnson has single-handedly thwarted legislation calling for installation of a plaque honoring the law enforcement officers who battled pro-Trump rioters to protect the Capitol and its inhabitants — including one Mike Johnson. Disgraceful doesn’t even begin to describe the affront to their bravery and sacrifice. Politics Column: Compassion and decency are lost amid wildfires as California foes seek cheap political points In their haste to politicize one of the worst natural disasters in California history, Donald Trump and many allies don’t bother offering hopes and prayers. Their callous response is unprecedented. Jan. 10, 2025 “What they went through was just horrendous,” California Rep. Zoe Lofgren said of the men and women who threw their bodies into the breach to protect lawmakers, staff members and reporters covering Congress. “Honestly, they saved us. They saved my life and they saved democracy.” Trump has said he plans to pardon some of the rioters soon after lifting his hand from the Bible and assuming office. In his up-is-down, ignorance-is-strength mindset, those lawbreakers are the actual victims of the violent assault on our country and its foundational principles. Advertisement So it’s worth remembering how on that “day of love,” as Trump has described it, police were set upon by thugs wielding baseball bats, flagpoles, tasers, pepper spray and iron pipes. More than 140 officers were injured. Several died in the aftermath . The “normal tourist visit,” as one Republican House member described the incursion on the Capitol, caused about $3 million in damage and resulted in criminal charges against more than 1,500 people. Try behaving that way at Disneyland. Advertisement A spending bill passed and signed into law in March 2022 required the creation of the commemorative plaque and its placement on the West Front of the Capitol, where some of the worst violence took place, within a year’s time. Lofgren, a San José Democrat who served on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack and Trump’s efforts to reverse his 2020 defeat , led the House Administration Committee when the law was enacted. After more than two years of inaction, she sent Johnson “a polite letter” noting the deadline had long passed and asking the reason for the delay. “I look forward to any information you can share to that end and what is being done to address it,” Lofgren wrote. To this day, she’s never heard back from the speaker. “Crickets,” Lofgren said in an interview. Last week, dozens of lawmakers — all Democrats — co-signed yet another letter to Johnson, again urging action and requesting a timeline for his follow-through. “I haven’t even looked at that,” he wanly told reporters when asked about the plaque. “I need to check on that.” The speaker, who owes his tenuous hold on the job entirely to Trump, appears to be the sole impediment to the memorial’s rightful installment. The Democratic House and Senate leaders both signed off, as did then-Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who has since vacated his leadership post and is expected to retire rather then seek reelection to his Senate seat next year. Advertisement Johnson’s motive is as obvious as the Capitol dome set against a blue sky: he’s kowtowing to Trump, lest he damage his eggshell ego or prick the incoming president’s gossamer-thin skin.

Print Poor Donald Trump. Twice elected president only to have to clean up the economic messes left to him by Democrats. In 2016, he groused about inheriting “a disaster” from Barack Obama. On Thursday, just four days before his second inauguration, he sent out a fundraising email claiming for the gazillionth time, “During my first term, we made the economy stronger than anyone ever thought possible. And then, Joe Biden came in and destroyed it.” Except that — no surprise — neither Trump claim is true. Opinion Columnist Jackie Calmes Jackie Calmes brings a critical eye to the national political scene. She has decades of experience covering the White House and Congress. Read more from Jackie Calmes In fact, it was Obama and Biden who were bequeathed messes, from former Republican presidents George W. Bush and Trump himself. Obama took office after what Ben Bernanke, then the Federal Reserve chair, called “the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression.” And four years ago, Biden confronted a nation mired in a pandemic and economic distress exacerbated by Trump’s response . Even Trump’s pre-pandemic economy, as good as it was, was far from “the greatest economy in the history of the world,” as he still contends. By various metrics, it was either no better or not as good as under Obama. Advertisement As for the handoff in 2017: “Trump inherits Obama boom,” said one headline ahead of his inauguration. And now he’s inheriting even better. “Biden is leaving a stellar economy,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, wrote as 2024 ended. Zandi expanded in October: “The economy is at full-employment, no more and no less. Wage growth is strong, and given big productivity gains, it is consistent with low and stable inflation. One couldn’t paint a prettier picture of the job market and broader economy.” In a letter to clients on Friday, UBS Financial Services declared this a new “Roaring ‘20s.” Opinion Calmes: The case of the missing Hegseth investigation Trump’s unfit nominee for Defense secretary gets the benefit of an incomplete, half-baked and secret FBI report. Jan. 16, 2025 And here’s another expert take that might come in handy while listening to Trump’s inaugural address Monday, should he resort to talk of “American carnage” as he did four years ago. Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, and Stephen Henriques, a fellow there, recently wrote , “As Trump bellows to crowds, ‘Are you better off economically than you were four years ago?’, the answer should be a loud YES!” Advertisement The problem for Biden, and for his replacement on Democrats’ losing 2024 ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris, many voters’ answer to that question was a loud “NO!” For one thing, the pain of pandemic-spawned high inflation lingers in what Americans pay for groceries, goods and services. And yet, it’s worth establishing the facts as a baseline to counter what are sure to be Trump’s claims that he not only revived a destroyed economy but topped his own (nonexistent) world record. The latest good news came Friday, when the International Monetary Fund forecast that the U.S. economy would grow faster this year than recently projected, given gains in employment and investment. The United States is buoying the global economy. “The big story is the divergence between the U.S. and the rest of the world,” IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters. Advertisement Opinion Calmes: Merrick Garland’s integrity saved the DOJ only to doom it again Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland’s uprightness rescued the Department of Justice from Donald Trump’s grip. But then he handed it over again. Jan. 12, 2025 But the fund’s forecast also echoed U.S. economists’ concerns that Trump’s agenda — more deficit-financed tax cuts, wholesale deregulation, across-the-board tariffs, immigration crackdowns and challenges to the Fed’s independence — could reignite inflation and add to the nation’s already unsustainable debt load. In other words, Trump could break what’s not broken. Inflation peaked at 9% at the midterm of the Biden administration, and as much as any issue, that helped elect Trump. It’s largely subsided , and good thing: After winning, Trump fessed up that, contrary to his campaign boasts, there’s not much he could do about inflation. “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up,” he told Time magazine . What’s worse is that his proposed tariffs — “my favorite word,” says Trump — could raise costs for a typical family about $1,700 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. And U.S. trading partners could raise those costs even m...",

Yoon, a former prosecutor, has denied the charges of insurrection, arguing that his declaration of martial law — during which hundreds of special forces commandos occupied the National Assembly — was meant only as a warning to an opposition-led legislature he claimed was overrun by North Korea sympathizers. He has called the arrest warrants against him illegal, thwarting one early arrest attempt by barricading himself in the presidential quarters in central Seoul, while also claiming that the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials — the agency leading his case — lacks the jurisdictional legitimacy to investigate him.

Print WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed Friday to take up a culture wars dispute and decide whether parents have a religious liberty right to have their children “opt out” of using school textbooks and lesson plans with LGBTQ+ themes. The court voted to hear an appeal from a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents in Montgomery County, Md., who objected to new storybooks for elementary school children that they said “celebrate gender transitioning, pride parades, and pronoun preferences with kids as young as three and four.” At first, the school board reacted to the complaints by saying parents could have their children excused from the class when the new textbooks were being used or discussed. Advertisement But after seeing a “growing number of opt out requests,” the school district reversed course in 2023 and said no opt-outs would be granted “for any reason.” The parents then sued in federal court, citing the 1st Amendment’s protection for the free exercise of religion. They were represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. After failing to win a court order in favor of the parents, they urged the Supreme Court to hear the case and to give parents an “opt out” right for books that they say offend their religious beliefs. Advertisement They argued many of the new “inclusivity” books for students from kindergarten to fifth grade champion a progressive ideology about gender and sexuality. They cited one book that told 3- and 4-year-olds to search for images from a word list that includes “intersex flag,” “drag queen,” “underwear,” “leather.” Another book advocated a child-knows-best approach to gender transitioning, they said. Eric Baxter, senior counsel at Becket, welcomed the court’s intervention. “Cramming down controversial gender ideology on three-year-olds without their parents’ permission is an affront to our nation’s traditions, parental rights, and basic human decency,” he said in a statement. “The court must make clear: parents, not the state, should be the ones deciding how and when to introduce their children to sensitive issues about gender and sexuality.” Advertisement Last month, the school district’s lawyers said there was no reason for the justices to take up the case. “Every court of appeals that has considered the question has held that mere exposure to controversial issues in a public-school curriculum does not burden the free religious exercise of parents or students,” they said. “Parents who choose to send their children to public school are not deprived of their right to freely exercise their religion simply because their children are exposed to curricular materials the parents find offensive.” The justices are likely to schedule the case of Mahmoud vs. Taylor for arguments in late April.

Print Brad Pitt’s representatives have responded to reports about a French woman allegedly being scammed out of more than $800,000 by a person  pretending to be the Oscar winner online. “It’s awful that scammers take advantage of fans’ strong connection with celebrities, but this is an important reminder to not respond to unsolicited online outreach, especially from actors who have no social media presence,” a spokesperson for the “Fight Club” star said Friday in a statement to The Times. Movies A guide to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s bitter eight-year Hollywood divorce Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie began with a whirlwind romance, then followed it up with a divorce four times as long as their marriage. Here’s a guide to the drama. Dec. 31, 2024 The woman, identified as an interior designer named Anne, told French media that scammers led her to believe that she was  involved with the “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood” Oscar winner for a year and a half and persuaded her to loan him money to help pay for medical expenses, the BBC reported. Her interview aired in prime time on Sunday on French TV’s TF1, but the segment has since been removed from the news outlet’s website following an onslaught of ridicule. Advertisement “I just got played, I admit it, and that’s why I came forward, because I am not the only one,” she said on a popular French YouTube show, per the BBC. Anne, who said she was new to social media, said she first downloaded Instagram in February 2023. The scammers immediately contacted her, first posing as Pitt’s mother, Jane Etta, then as the star a day later. She said she was told that Pitt had kidney cancer, was financially strapped because of his recent divorce agreement and needed help paying bills. The scammers also sent her multiple AI-generated images of Pitt appearing to be in a hospital bed, and she complied. Movies A guide to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s bitter eight-year Hollywood divorce Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt on Monday signed off on a default declaration filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, settling their eight-year divorce. Dec. 31, 2024 “At first I said to myself that it was fake, that it’s ridiculous,” she told TF1. “But I’m not used to social media and I didn’t really understand what was happening to me.” Advertisement They duped the woman, a cancer survivor, into sending the purported Pitt her life’s savings, including a divorce settlement from her marriage to a wealthy entrepreneur. Anne said that nearly every time she cast doubt on Pitt’s authenticity, the scammers would send her something to dissipate her doubts, at one point AI-generating a fake news report about their relationship ahead of the actor going public with girlfriend Ines de Ramon in June 2024. Pitt and De Ramon’s relationship confirmation is ultimately what led Anne to end her romance with the person she believed to be Pitt. Shortly thereafter, scammers contacted her posing as “Special FBI Agent John Smith,” prompting her to contact the police. The BBC reported that an investigation is now underway. Technology and the Internet Real-time deepfakes are a dangerous new threat. How to protect yourself In a frightening use of deepfake technology, scammers are using AI-powered audio and video to pass themselves off as their targets’ relatives or loved ones in real time.

Savage Staff Writer Jan. 17, 2025 Updated 8:30 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a law that calls for the shutdown of the U.S. operations of social media app TikTok due to privacy and security concerns related to its Chinese owner. The justices in a unanimous opinion said the 2024 law does not violate the 1st Amendment or its protection for freedom of speech. The ruling means 170 million Americans may lose access to the popular social media platform as soon as Sunday. “There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,” the court said in an unsigned opinion. “But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary. .. we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners’ 1st Amendment rights.” Advertisement The decision appears to leave the U.S. fate of TikTok to either a last-minute sale by its Chinese owners, or a reprieve from President Biden or President-elect Donald Trump. Trump takes office on Monday, the day after the shut-down law is due to take effect. Recently, Trump has said he will try to work out a deal that keeps TikTok in operation, presumably by separating it from Chinese government control. Last year, the House and Senate by large bipartisan votes approved the shut-down law, citing national security fears that ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, was gathering data on tens of millions of Americans. Advertisement Congress decided TikTok must separate itself from its ownership by a “foreign adversary.” In defense of the law, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices that TikTok and ByteDance “collect vast swaths of data about tens of millions of Americans,” which China “could use for espionage or blackmail.” In its 20-page “per curiam” opinion Friday, the court said the case turned on the ownership and control of TikTok, not free speech. While TikTok is “operated in the United States by TikTok Inc., an American company incorporated and headquartered in California,” its “ultimate parent company is ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company that has operations in China. ByteDance Ltd. owns TikTok’s proprietary algorithm...and is subject to Chinese laws that require it to ‘assist or cooperate’ with the Chinese government’s ‘intelligence work’ and to ensure that the Chinese Government has ‘the power to access and control private data’ the company holds.” Advertisement Second, the court said the shut-down law is not targeted at speech or expression. The 1st Amendment protects against the government’s efforts to control the “content” of the speech, but that is not at issue in this case, the court said. The law “does not regulate the creators...and directly regulates ByteDance and TikTok only through the divestiture requirement.” The free-speech advocates who sued to block the law “have not identified any case in which this court has treated a regulation of corporate control as a direct regulation of expressive activity or semi-expressive conduct. We hesitate to break that new ground in this unique case.” Biden and his administration tried and failed to make progress on a separation agreement. Government lawyers told the court they did not find ByteDance to be trustworthy. But Trump may see it differently. Though he originally supported efforts to ban TikTok in the U.S., he recently changed his position. “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” Trump said last month. One provision of the law allows the president to give TikTok a 90-day extension if it is determined there has been “significant progress” toward arranging a “qualified divestiture” from its foreign owners.

Dec. 31, 1996 Plowright may be remembered as the third and final wife of British  acting legend Laurence Olivier, but she leaves behind an impressive legacy of her own that spanned theater, film and television. By the first year of her marriage to Olivier, Plowright was a Tony-winning actor (she won for “A Taste of Honey” in 1961) who had graced stages on Broadway and in London, including as a member of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre.  She was also a BAFTA-nominated star who earned critical praise for her performance in Tony Richardson’s 1960 film, “The Entertainer,” which also starred Olivier as her father. Plowright, however, saw even more professional success  after Olivier’s death in 1989, as she delivered memorable performances in films throughout the ’90s and early aughts, including “Enchanted April,” “Stalin,” The Scarlet Letter” and “The Spiderwick Chronicles.” Advertisement Joan Plowright and actor Laurence Olivier married in 1961 and welcomed three children. (Associated Press) In director Mike Newell‘s “Enchanted April,” Plowright shared the screen with Alfred Molina, Miranda Richardson and Polly Walker as the elderly Mrs. Fisher, one of four women  seeking respite on an Italian vacation. Plowright’s “Enchanted April” performance earned her her first and only Academy Award nomination, for supporting actress. At the 1993 Golden Globes, Plowright earned two awards: a supporting actress in a motion picture prize for “Enchanted April,” and a supporting actress in a series, miniseries or TV movie for “Stalin.” Plowright often portrayed the grandmotherly type in a variety of films, including family-friendly titles “101 Dalmatians” and “Dennis the Menace.” In a 1996 interview with The Times , Plowright said she didn’t mind. Advertisement “When you get such interesting and amusing film roles, it doesn’t seem dreadfully exciting to be in the 257th revival of ‘The Rivals,’” she said. “And it’s fun setting off all over the world — and being extremely well-paid.” Joan Plowright earned an Oscar nomination for her work in the film “Enchanted April.” (Nick Ut / Associated Press) In film, Plowright’s credits include “Tea With Mussolini,” “Surviving Picasso,” “I Love You to Death,” “Avalon“and “Drowning by Numbers.”  Her television appearances include “Encore! Encore!” and  the movies “On Promised Land,” “A Place for Annie” and “Back to the Secret Garden.” The actor was also one of four subjects of the Roger Michell documentary “Nothing Like a Dame.” The 2018 project celebrated the careers of Plowright and her fellow actor-dames Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. Plowright was born Oct. 28, 1929, in Brigg , North Lincolnshire, England, to  journalist and editor  William Ernest Plowright, and his wife, Daisy Margaret. She began her acting in plays put on by her mother. At age 15, she won a drama cup and with it  the chance to spend a week in a minor role with the Harry Hanson Players. After she was rejected for the role (Hanson  told her, “Go home, my dear, go home”), she received a scholarship to study at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.

Print A city devastated; neighbors coming to its aid; the hunt for a scapegoat: Though the Angelenos enduring wildfires today lead lives dramatically different from those of the people who survived the Halifax Explosion more than a century ago, the stories of the two disasters intermittently rhyme. On the morning of Dec. 6, 1917, an accidental collision of two ships in Halifax Harbour set off an uncontrollable fire. One of the ships was a Belgian relief vessel; the other was the SS Mont-Blanc, a French munitions ship packed to the gills with explosives such as TNT, picric acid, benzol and guncotton. The disaster was one of the largest accidental human-caused explosions of all time, killing close to 1,800 people and destroying or damaging more than 12,000 structures in the blink of an eye. When Boston sent Halifax a train laden with supplies and medical staff through a historic snowstorm, it marked a striking early instance of coordinated international disaster relief. So as I watched canary-yellow Canadian Super Scooper planes roar into Los Angeles to help douse the ungovernable firestorms threatening my home, my grieving Nova Scotian heart soared: reciprocity between old friends. Advertisement But our city can also glean lessons from the Halifax Explosion — especially about the dangers of scapegoating in a time of crisis. The example of Francis Mackey, the Halifax mariner who was blamed for the disaster, is a reminder that emotionally charged finger-pointing in the aftermath of a catastrophe often finds the wrong lightning rod. Mackey — whose story we know thanks largely to the historian Janet Maybee’s book “Aftershock: The Halifax Explosion and the Persecution of Pilot Francis Mackey” — was tasked with guiding the Mont-Blanc into the harbor, and, miraculously, he survived the blast. Facing the devastation, the public immediately sought someone to blame, and Mackey, an experienced maritime pilot, served as a convenient scapegoat for the government. He was stripped of his pilot’s license, arrested, imprisoned, vilified in the press and — along with the ship’s captain and the naval officer who oversaw the harbor — charged with manslaughter. Ultimately, a Nova Scotia Supreme Court justice examined the facts and found Mackey innocent. But the public persecution and reputational damage were done. Mackey, cursed as a “murderer” in the streets, was yet another victim in a shattered city. Advertisement In the end, no single person could be held responsible for Halifax’s explosion. The answer was less exciting and more obvious: The disaster was an extraordinary accident in a country at war and a community in the blast zone of a massive arsenal. Similarly, Los Angeles’ disaster is a product of human-caused climate change colliding with an electrified city built amid combustible chaparral. While the search for answers and lessons is warranted, we would be wise to practice forbearance and refrain from casting personal blame for a little while. Besmirching Mayor Karen Bass for traveling abroad, prematurely accusing anyone of arson or inventing conspiracy theories about who turned off our hydrants will not douse a single flame, rebuild a single home or bring a single loved one back from the dead. As in Halifax, no single individual is or ever could be to blame. Advertisement Renowned for our imagination, hustle and open-mindedness, Angelenos are called by this disaster to show magnanimity in the face of devastation. And if you look in the right places, we already are. One hundred eight years later, no one who lived through the Halifax Explosion is left. But the Hydrostone, the Halifax neighborhood we rebuilt with American assistance, remains. And every winter since, as the anniversary of the explosion approaches, Nova Scotians send one of our finest evergreens to Boston Common: a Christmas gift and a symbol of our enduring gratitude for the city’s help in our darkest hour.

(Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times) By Andrea Castillo and Koko Nakajima Jan. 17, 2025 3 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print WASHINGTON — A historic uptick in migration during Joe Biden’s presidency led to attacks as he ran for reelection, with Donald Trump and fellow Republicans blaming Democrats for the swelling number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, after campaigning on promises to secure the border and deport undocumented immigrants, President-elect Trump is poised to take office Monday amid a steep drop in border crossings. Here are five key facts about migration across the U.S.-Mexico border over the last several years. Advertisement 1. Arrivals at the border are the lowest they’ve been since Trump left office When Trump left office in January 2021, people were stopped at the southern border more than 78,000 times that month, according to figures from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That’s compared with roughly 96 ,000 stops last month . The highest monthly total during the Biden administration was nearly 302,000 in December 2023, and Trump’s highest total was just over 144,000 in May 2019 . These figures include arrivals at land ports of entry, where asylum seekers wait for appointments to enter legally, as well as those caught crossing illegally elsewhere along the border. Figures from November and December showed, for the first time, more migrants being processed through ports of entry than those who were arrested after entering the U.S. illegally. Advertisement In June, the Biden administration began effectively blocking migrants from seeking asylum along the U.S. border with Mexico. The restrictions don’t apply to those who enter at official ports of entry or use other legal means. For parts of last year, San Diego became the top destination for illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time in decades. The change reflects how smuggling routes, which used to be consistent for many years, have begun to shift every few months since 2021. That’s in part because of the post-pandemic increase in global migration to the U.S. The San Diego region saw 10,117 border arrests in December — the second-highest after the Rio Grande Valley in Texas — though that’s down by 70% from a year earlier. Advertisement 2. There hasn’t been much of an increase in border arrivals ahead of Trump’s inauguration In the weeks leading up to Trump’s inauguration, most regions across the border have seen little change in arrivals of migrants. But Chief Border Patrol Agent Gloria Chavez of the Rio Grande Valley Sector in south Texas, who posts local arrest numbers on social media every week, reported 1,206 migrant stops over the final weekend of December, and 1,276 the weekend before . That’s double the number in recent weeks of fewer than 600 arrests . “It is the first quantitative indicator of an increase in migration since the U.S. election, which raised expectations — so far unmet — that many migrants might rush to enter the United States before Election Day,” Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight at the advocacy organization the Washington Office on Latin America , wrote in a recent newsletter. That trend appeared to have waned in the new year, with Chavez reporting 669 arrests the weekend that ended Jan. 5 and 699 arrests the weekend that ended Jan. 12. Isacson noted that in 2016, asylum seekers rushed to enter the U.S. before Trump began his first term. But border policies are different now, with Biden administration rules already preventing most people who enter illegally from qualifying for asylum. “Their only hope is to not be apprehended,” he said. “Some people might be trying, and if they’re successful they won’t show up in the numbers.” Advertisement Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the left-leaning American Immigration Council, said tens of thousands of migrants are waiting in Mexico. “Today it is harder for migrants to make it to the border and seek asylum than at any point in modern U.S. history,” he said. “Despite this massively increased infrastructure at the border, the U.S. continues to remain, in the eyes of people around the world, a place of safety and security.” 3. The U.S. border used to draw mostly Mexican and Central American migrants. Now people from all over the world flock here The U.S. has historically drawn migrants from its southern neighbor. Although Mexicans still make up the highest proportion of those seeking entry, arrivals of people from other countries have shot up over time. During Trump’s first term, people from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador flocked to the U.S. border due to instability in their home countries. That started to change around 2019 . Throughout Biden’s presidency, greater numbers of people began to arrive...",

Rob Bonta and others say they will challenge any new measures that violate the Constitution or existing law. From the start of his campaign to retake the White House, President-elect Donald Trump promised to go big on his first day back in power. In a series of early videos outlining his plans and in stump speeches across the country, Trump said he would use executive orders on “Day 1” to bypass the normal legislative process and secure major changes to U.S. policy with the simple stroke of his pen. He promised to unilaterally upend the long-recognized constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship by signing an executive order informing federal agencies that, “under the correct interpretation of the law,” children of undocumented immigrants do not automatically receive citizenship by being born on U.S. soil. Advertisement He said he would “reverse the disastrous effects of Biden’s inflation and rebuild the greatest economy in the history of the world,” place new restrictions on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, halt the transition to electric vehicles in favor of fossil fuels, and use a decades-old public health statute known as Title 42 and the U.S. military to initiate “the largest domestic deportation effort in American history.” “We will secure our borders and we will restore our sovereignty starting on Day 1,” Trump said. “Our country will be great again.” Politics Trump promises to ‘save’ America with mix of lofty, vague, legally dubious policies Former President Trump has staked out an array of policy positions for a second term, many of them lofty, vague, or legally dubious ideas. Aug. 14, 2024 Trump’s promises have long excited Republicans and set Democrats on edge, but the anticipation has built ahead of his inauguration Monday, especially as media outlets have reported more than 100 executive orders are in the works and conservative members of Congress have said the president-elect  intends to move quickly and aggressively — with their encouragement. Advertisement President Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House in 2019. (Yuri Gripas / Pool Photo ) “There is going to be shock and awe with executive orders,” Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican and the Senate majority whip, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “A blizzard of executive orders on the economy, as well as on the border.” Rep. August Pfluger, a Texas Republican, told Fox News Digital that a House caucus he leads — the Republican Study Committee — recently received a briefing on what to expect from Trump’s deputy chief of policy, Stephen Miller. The group “is in lockstep with the incoming Trump administration” and “committed to working around the clock to deliver on the promises we made to the American people, especially when it comes to securing our border and enforcing immigration policies,” Pfluger said. Advertisement What Trump’s plans will mean for the nation — and on what timeline — is not clear. Executive orders indicate a president’s intention to take swift action without waiting on Congress, but initiating their underlying policies often takes time, experts said — requiring a president’s Cabinet appointments to win confirmation and his administration to settle in first. “There’s a lot that’s possible, but not on ‘Day 1,’” said Bert Rockman, a professor emeritus of political science at Purdue University and an expert on executive and presidential powers. “The expectation that a lot of things are going to be done right off the bat, above and beyond [Trump’s] mouth, is probably precipitous.” There is also the matter of legal challenges.

Gen. Rob Bonta. “We’ve been talking, preparing, planning. We have [legal] briefs on the shelf where we just need to dot the I’s, cross the Ts, press print and file,” Bonta said in an interview with The Times. “We’ve listened to what Mr. Trump has been saying, his inner circle has been projecting, what Project 2025 says in black and white in print, and preparing for all the possibilities.” Immigrant rights and other advocacy groups have also been preparing for a fight, including in consultation with Bonta’s office and at “Know Your Rights” events throughout the Los Angeles region, said Angélica Salas, executive director of the Coal...",

One recent incident targeted a tomb near Sinaloa’s capital Culiacán said to belong to the family of Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada. Two sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán are in custody in the United States, with one accused of kidnapping El Mayo The charred husk of an artificial Christmas tree smoldered in the aftermath of the fire, ashes coating the tiled floor as flames still licked at the scorched ceiling. The burned structure is the size of a modest living room, and it was built with a similar purpose: A place for loved ones to gather and enjoy each others’ company on holidays or special occasions. But the edifice is no home — it’s a tomb in Mexico’s Sinaloa state, allegedly targeted for arson earlier this month because it belongs to the family of Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, reputed co-founder of the country’s most powerful drug cartel. Advertisement After decades on the run, Zambada, 78, was arrested by U.S. authorities in July at an airport near El Paso. Since his capture, which he claimed in a letter from jail was orchestrated by a son of his longtime partner, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, war has erupted among rival cartel factions. VIDEO | 01:35 Tomb belonging to family of reputed cartel leader ‘El Mayo’ Zambada burned in Mexico As the cradle of Mexico’s narco culture, Sinaloa has seen its share of horrific violence during cartel feuds of years past. The desecration of tombs, however, is a stark indication of the deep enmity that has developed between El Chapo’s adult sons, known as “Los Chapitos,” and those who cooperated in the U.S. case against their father. Advertisement It is customary in Sinaloa — particularly among families of fallen drug traffickers — to construct elaborate tombs to honor the dead. The most ostentatious resemble small churches or even condo-style apartments with air conditioning, TVs and couches where families can comfortably spend time together. Jardines del Humaya, a sprawling cemetery on the outskirts of Sinaloa’s capital, Culiacán, contains several enormous mausoleums, including one made to resemble the Taj Mahal. Jardines del Humaya, a cemetery on the outskirts of Culiacán, Mexico,contains many large mausoleums that are the final resting place for some of the state’s most prominent drug traffickers. (Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times) At least two desecrations have occurred so far. The most recent involved a Zambada tomb built for one of El Mayo’s grandchildren, said to have died as a 7-year-old boy in an ATV accident. He was the son of Vicente Zambada Niebla, heir apparent to the cartel throne until his 2009 arrest in Mexico City. After he was extradited to the U.S., Zambada Niebla cooperated with federal authorities and served as a key witness during El Chapo’s trial in 2019. Advertisement Sources with knowledge of the recent incident, who requested anonymity over concerns of potential retaliation, said men ransacked and torched the Zambada mausoleum located near Culiacán on Jan. 4. World & Nation For Subscribers The secretive life — and stunning downfall — of Sinaloa cartel boss ‘El Mayo’ Zambada There is growing evidence to suggest Ismael ‘El Mayo’ Zambada was hauled against his will from Mexico to El Paso in an effort by El Chapo’s son to curry favor with U.S. authorities. Aug. 1, 2024 Days after the burning of the tomb, the sources said, men returned to inflict more damage and remove the remains of several Zambada relatives. Zambada Niebla is believed to be under witness protection in the United States. His lawyer, Frank Perez — who also represents El Mayo — declined to comment. The elder Zambada has pleaded not guilty to an array of federal charges, including for alleged murders, which could carry the death penalty. He appeared before a judge Wednesday, where he told the court he trusted Perez to continue handling his case despite a potential conflict of interest also representing his son, Zambada Niebla, who could be called as a witness if the case goes to trial. The proceeding was held in the same Brooklyn courthouse where El Chapo was convicted of drug smuggling, money laundering and weapons charges. He is serving a life sentence in U.S. federal prison, and an appeals court denied a last-ditch effort to have his conviction overturned on Jan. 10.

Print The residents of Canberra might know a little about what Los Angeles is going through . Exactly 22 years ago, a wildfire became a devastating urban fire in the Australian capital. On Jan. 18, 2003, what began as a bushfire — as they are known in Australia — started by a lightning strike in the outlying mountain ranges quickly pushed its way into residential suburbs, propelled by powerful gusts. Feeding it were the trees and grasses that give the city its “bush capital” moniker but were primed to burn by the previous year’s drought. The inferno , which burned for five days and saw walls of flames 18 miles wide, killed four people, injured hundreds and destroyed more than 480 homes in the city of half a million. Advertisement A firefighter attends to a fire near Wooroloo, northeast of Perth, Australia, on Feb. 2, 2021. (Evan Collis / Associated Press) Along with the 2019-2020 bushfire season known as Black Summer, which killed 34 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes across the country, the 2003 fires remain a painful memory for many Australians. Climate & Environment Could better brush clearance have helped slow the spread of the Palisades fire? As the Palisades fire raged, critics blamed overgrown vegetation for driving its spread. But some scientists and fire officials say removing it may not have made much of a difference, and also risks making the landscape more flammable in the long run. Jan. 13, 2025 ”It looked like it was raining fire because there were so many embers and there were really, really strong winds,” said Rohan Scott, a firefighter on the scene at the time. Advertisement Today, Scott is the chief of the Australian Capital Territory’s Rural Fire Service, which oversees Canberra’s outlying regions. The Times spoke with him about the 2003 tragedy and how it changed the city’s approach to fire prevention. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. What was your reaction to the L.A. fires? Did anything remind you of Canberra in 2003? If you look at the devastation and the conditions, just the sheer fire behavior, the wind, there are similarities. Advertisement In 2003, if a house was on fire, we had to leave that house on fire. We had to protect the ones next to it because the winds were so strong. Even if we had a truck at every house, I would probably say we would still have lost houses. I think the firefighters in L.A. did an exceptional job considering the winds. People have to understand that those embers are really, really small. They get into the smallest cavities of a house by the time they’re taken hold, it’s gone. How did the 2003 fire change Australian firefighting or fire prevention ? We now have what we call asset protection zones and bushfire management standards. Between a house and the vegetation, there has to be a zone that has to be maintained. So if it’s a grass buffer, it must be mown and kept to a certain standard. If there are trees, the tree fuel loads must be kept to a certain standard. California How you can help the incarcerated firefighters battling L.A. wildfires The Los Angeles-based Anti-Recidivism Coalition, a nonprofit dedicated to ending mass incarceration, started a fundraiser on Friday to support the fire crews of California’s prisons. Jan. 11, 2025 We’ve also got bushfire modeling software and we know where a fire is going to run in a bushfire-prone area. And if you build on those areas now, there’s a certain standard that your house must be built to. There are certain building materials that you must use to make it more fire-resistant. I myself live in a bushfire-prone area and I’m building a deck off the side of my house. I’m using not a timber product but a renewable plastic product because it’s not susceptible to fire. Advertisement A helicopter drops fire retardant on a fire near Wooroloo, northeast of Perth, Australia, on Feb. 2, 2021. (Evan Collis / Associated Press) How strictly are these vegetation management regulations enforced? Our bushfire management standards are legislation — they’re law. We actually go out as a fire service and audit those bushfire abatement zones and asset protection zones. We also have crews that will go out and remove that vegetation: the dead leaves, the dead sticks and branches that are on the ground. And when you rebuild a property, we encourage people to grow certain types of plants that are less prone to fire. Los Angeles has been reluctant to use controlled burns to reduce the buildup of fuel. What does Canberra do in this regard? It’s just one tool that we can use out of many. It does reduce fuel, but it can only be done under certain weather conditions. The wind has got t...",

The third bill would increase FEMA funding for positioning firefighting tools in high-risk areas before disaster strikes. WASHINGTON — While firefighters continue to battle the Los Angeles County fires, California’s Sen. Alex Padilla is introducing a package of bills to increase their pay and create housing for those affected by disasters — which could later add to the state’s affordable housing supply. “Just like the firefighters on the lines right now, putting out the fires, we have to work together in our response and our recovery,” Padilla said in an interview with The Times in his U.S. Senate office. His proposal, the Disaster Housing Reform for American Families Act , ties together two of California’s top priorities: wildfire assistance and affordable housing. Advertisement Live Bouts of heavy rain bring flooding, mudflows The Federal Emergency Management Agency will be providing temporary housing, such as trailers, to many of the thousands of people who lost their homes in the wildfires. Padilla’s bill, which he is co-leading with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), would require the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to quickly create housing that could later function as longer-term, affordable housing. “We can be a little bit smarter about this and allow for the use of modular homes, manufactured homes that are themselves a little bit more sustainable, more resilient,” he said. “Once the disaster is over and folks are moving back into their communities, maybe utilize them, retain them locally for affordable housing.” The measure could serve as “another tool in the toolbox,” Padilla said, noting that some landlords already are price gouging in the wake of the fires. Advertisement Politics California’s wildfire recovery faces political challenges in Republican-led Washington Trump takes office in less than a week, but California’s road to recovery will take months, and politics might get in the way. Jan. 14, 2025 Another measure, the Fire Suppression and Response Funding Assurance Act , would expand funding from FEMA for firefighting tools that are put in place before a disaster. The bill would allow for FEMA to cover more of those resources at times of high wildfire risk, before disaster strikes. “In California, we know that when it’s hot and it’s been dry and the winds kick up, it’s a recipe for disaster. So we can anticipate those conditions. Let’s start putting personnel and equipment in place just in case,” Padilla said, adding that he checks the fires’ progression on the WatchDuty app hourly. “If we can ensure that the program will pick up at least 75% of that, that’s a huge incentive for state and local governments to be able to do just that, with less concern for the budget.” Padilla recalled a trip he took as a staff member for the late U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), with a former FEMA director in 1996, to survey wildfire damage. Leaders have learned much about fire prevention techniques since then, he noted, such as building with nonflammable materials and clearing brush away from houses. Advertisement Padilla is also bringing back the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act , which was not voted on after he introduced it during the last Congress, to raise wages for federal firefighters, including premium pay for those fighting long fires. Firefighter pay has been the subject of legislation in the last few years, as President Biden raised the minimum wage from $13 to $15 an hour for wildland firefighters in 2021. Padilla’s legislation is aimed at beefing up the Forest Service’s ability to recruit and retain firefighters with promises of higher pay. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, federal firefighters make, on average, slightly less than state or local firefighters. California unsurprisingly is home to the most firefighters of any states, and pays the best too. A 2019 study from BLS reported that California paid an average annual salary of $84,370.

Print For folks who have so harshly turned on the FBI for supposedly targeting Donald Trump over the years, Republicans sure are quick to turn to the bureau when they need a cover-up, er, background check to salvage a troubled Trump pick for high office. In October 2018, the beneficiary was Brett M. Kavanaugh. Then-President Trump and a Senate Republican majority directed the FBI to investigate sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee to placate Republican senators whose threatened opposition could sink his nomination. Opinion Columnist Jackie Calmes Jackie Calmes brings a critical eye to the national political scene. She has decades of experience covering the White House and Congress. Read more from Jackie Calmes But as I learned in researching a book at the time, the Trump White House told the FBI whom its agents could contact, ignoring willing witnesses with damning information, and gave them just days to finish. The bureau’s slapdash Kavanaugh report, merely summarizing agents’ interviews without drawing conclusions, was enough political cover for Trump and Senate Republicans to falsely claim he’d been exonerated. Democrats correctly insisted otherwise. Yet it was their word against the Republicans’ since the senators-only report remains secret to this day. Advertisement And Kavanaugh, comfortably settled into his lifetime seat on the nation’s highest court, voted last Thursday — fortunately on the losing side — in favor of blocking  Trump’s sentencing for covering up hush-money payments to a porn star. Trump isn’t even back in the White House and he’s already replayed the FBI card — call it the Trump card — and again apparently successfully, this time for his manifestly unfit choice for Defense secretary, former Fox News host and former National Guard officer Pete Hegseth. With another incomplete, half-baked and secret FBI background check related to alleged sexual assault and excessive drinking, Hegseth got through his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday without a dissenting voice from the Armed Services Committee’s Republican majority. That Hegseth,  once considered a dead nominee walking , now looks likely to get confirmed is a shame on the Senate. In 1989, Texas Republican John Tower’s reputation for womanizing and drinking got him rejected as President George H.W. Bush’s Defense nominee, and Tower was a fellow senator. In the Trump era, however, Republican senators would rather abandon their constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on presidential nominations than stand up to the vindictive Trump. But few are fooled: Many if not most of the Republicans know Hegseth has no business atop the Pentagon, with its nearly 3 million employees and $900-billion annual budget. Advertisement As for Trump, the Hegseth episode is evidence just days before his Monday inauguration that the returning president will again abuse his powers over the departments of government, probably more than in his first term. After all, the Supreme Court’s 6-3 right-wing supermajority that he built has since conferred immunity on Trump and future presidents for crimes committed under the guise of official acts. And unlike in his first term, Trump is hiring proven sycophants. Just compare Hegseth to Trump’s first Defense secretary, James N. Mattis, a four-star Marine general, commander in the Persian Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq and, out of combat, a top Pentagon official. Mattis lasted two years before resigning in principled protest over Trump’s erratic military decisions. It’s a safe bet that Trump couldn’t have chosen someone so lacking and flawed as Hegseth at the outset of his first term — before his total subjugation of the Republican Party — for fear of bipartisan rejection. Advertisement One more lesson from this sorry saga (though I have no hope it will be learned): It’s past time to stop the charade of ordering up FBI background checks that aren’t, and portraying them as seals of approval for undeserving presidential picks. Initially, Team Trump opposed FBI checks for the president-elect’s controversial Cabinet choices. But the Mar-a-Lago mafia reconsidered after media reports of Hegseth’s alleged sexual misconduct, repeated public drunkenness and financial mismanagement of two small veterans groups seemed to all but doom his chances of confirmation. In December, Trump’s transition team commissioned the FBI to “investigate” Hegseth. All parties followed the Kavanaugh investigation playbook: The Trump team, as the FBI’s client, told the agency whom to question. The bureau ignored others , according to ...",

Under earlier Trump programs, many asylum seekers sent to Mexico fell victim to crime and became a burden for towns housing them. MEXICO CITY — Mexican authorities have repeatedly vowed to welcome back their citizens should the incoming Trump administration proceed with threats of large-scale deportations. “It’s our obligation,” said President Claudia Sheinbaum , who has outlined plans to boost assistance for millions of Mexican citizens facing potential deportation from the United States — and increase aid for those forced back to Mexico. But less clear, and more problematic, is how Mexico’s leaders will respond if, as expected, President-elect Donald Trump pressures them to accept deportees from other countries as well — either asylum seekers immediately sent back from the border or migrants living in the United States. Advertisement “This will be one of the first pressures facing Mexico,” said Eunice Rendón, a columnist and expert in migrant issues.  “Donald Trump is going to want to send people who aren’t Mexicans back to Mexico, especially those from countries like Venezuela, with which the United States doesn’t have diplomatic relations.” Mexico is under no legal obligation to take back noncitizens, even if many traveled through Mexico to reach U.S. territory. But in the past it has relented under the threat of tariffs that could cripple its economy. Politics Will Trump send troops to Mexico? His pick for ambassador worries officials there With his pick for ambassador to Mexico, Trump signals that he might be serious about sending U.S. troops to fight the drug cartels Dec. 23, 2024 Trump again is vowing massive tariffs unless Mexico — which sends more than 80% of its exports north of the border — capitulates to his demands. That leaves Mexico with little leverage to push back, experts say. Advertisement In December, Sheinbaum said her government preferred Washington send non-Mexicans directly back to their homelands, leaving Mexico out of it. But she recently signaled that Mexico may work with the U.S. on accepting some third-country nationals. Trump’s next administration is reported to be considering reviving in some fashion two of its controversial programs — known as Remain in Mexico and Title 42 — that sent back into Mexico tens of thousands of non-Mexican asylum seekers detained at the Southwest border. Under Remain in Mexico, they were turned back to await U.S. court appearances. Under Title 42, a public health measure invoked during the COVID-19 pandemic, migrants were immediately returned to Mexico without court dates.

Jan. 8, 2025 Many of the asylum seekers fell victim to crime and became a burden for Mexican cities and towns housing them. The Biden administration ended both programs. Advertisement During  Trump’s first administration, Mexico agreed to accept non-Mexican deportees, limited mostly to Spanish speakers from Central and South America and Cuba, as well as Haitians. Sheinbaum said this month that Mexican officials could “collaborate, through different mechanisms,” with their U.S. counterparts. She and her representatives have not clarified what terms Mexico would seek. But analysts say they will undoubtedly push for caps on the numbers and nationalities of deportees. World & Nation Mexico cracks down on drugs and migrants. Will it be enough to stop Trump tariffs? Mexico’s president walks a fine line between pleasing her constituents and placating Trump. Dec. 12, 2024 “I can see Mexico agreeing to accept some third-country nationals apprehended at the border, and taking those back,” said Adam Isacson, an analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America, a research and advocacy group. “That has already been happening.” After President Biden ended Title 42, Mexico agreed to accept up to 30,000 expelled migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela — countries that, for political and other reasons, pose challenges for direct deportations from the United States. That agreement remains in place. “The really hard thing for Mexico would be if the Trump administration tries to force Mexico to receive Venezuelans and others who are living in...",

Print WASHINGTON  — Thanks to the internet and smartphones, children today have instant access to vast amounts of online pornography, much of it graphic, violent and degrading, Texas state attorneys told the Supreme Court on Wednesday. They urged justices to restore the rules of an earlier era, when X-rated theaters and bookstores had an adults-only policy. Last year, Texas enacted an age-verification law that requires pornographic websites to confirm their users are 18 or older. Advertisement Lawyers for 23 other Republican-led states joined in support of Texas, saying they have or plan to adopt similar measures. The court’s conservative justices signaled they are prepared to uphold these new laws. They noted that age-verification rules are now common for online gambling and for buying alcohol or tobacco online. But more importantly, they pointed to the dramatic change in technology and the easy availability of hardcore pornography. Advertisement We are “in an entirely different era,” said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. “The technological access to pornography has exploded.” He said that warrants reconsidering rulings from decades past that invoked the 1st Amendment to strike down anti-pornography measures. In one such ruling, the court in 2004 said parents and librarians could use filtering software to protect children from pornography. Advertisement Justice Amy Coney Barrett said parents have long known that “filtering” software is not effective in protecting children. “Kids can get online porn through gaming systems, tablets, phones and computers,” she said. “I can say from personal experience ... content filtering isn’t working.” In the past, she said, the court had no problem upholding laws that prevent bookstores from selling sexually explicit books or magazines to children or teens. She questioned why online porn should be treated differently. Washington attorney Derek Shaffer, who represented the adult entertainment industry, which challenged the Texas law on 1st Amendment grounds, argued that the law could have a “chilling effect” on adult customers who may be wary of providing personal information needed to verify age and identity. Texas state Solicitor Gen. Aaron Nielson said the new age-verification systems allow customers to confirm their age online without directly contacting a particular website. “Age verification is simple, safe and common,” he said. The justices and the attorneys spent most of their time on what free speech standard should apply to such a law. In the past, the court said anti-pornography laws must be viewed with “strict scrutiny.” Usually, that resulted in narrowing or striking down such laws. Advertisement By contrast, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the Texas law to take effect because it was a “rational” means of protecting children. Several of the justices said they would vote to uphold the state law, but they may also agree to send it back to the 5th Circuit Court for a second hearing. Republican-led states pointed to a growing pornography problem. “The average child is exposed to internet pornography while still in elementary school,” wrote state attorneys for Ohio and Indiana.   “Pornography websites receive more traffic in the U.S. than social media platforms Instagram, TikTok, Netflix, and Pinterest combined.” More to Read Supreme Court sounds ready to OK laws that ban hormone treatments for trans teens Dec. 4, 2024 New laws close gap in California on deepfake child pornography Oct. 3, 2024 Supreme Court blocks Biden’s new antidiscrimination rules for transgender students in red states Aug. 16, 2024",

Print Neil Gaiman , the bestselling fantasy author behind “The Sandman” comic books, and novels and shows “American Gods” and “Good Omens,” has emphatically denied ever engaging in nonconsensual sexual conduct after several women accused him of sexual assault in a New York magazine article. Eight women accused the 64-year-old British scribe of assault, abuse and coercion in  an article published Monday. Most of the allegations stemmed from the late ’90s to 2022, when he was living in the United States, Britain and New Zealand. Over the summer, five women — four of whom  were interviewed for the New York article — made accusations against Gaiman in the Tortoise Media podcast “Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman ,” claiming that the author asked them to call him “master” during their alleged sexual encounters. Awards Q&A: Neil Gaiman promised a dying friend he’d carry ‘Good Omens’ forward Neil Gaiman has thrived for decades on entertainment’s fringe, crafting novels (“American Gods”), comics (“The Sandman”) and YA books (“Coraline”) about gods, monsters and parents with button eyes. June 18, 2019 Gaiman has sold more than 50 million copies of his books worldwide, several of which have been adapted for film and television. The author, who has forthcoming projects with Netflix and Prime Video,  is one of the first modern comic-book writers to draw a large female readership. The allegations made by his accusers  clash with the self-proclaimed feminist writer’s  public persona. Many of the allegations against him involve domineering violence, a feature of BDSM that both parties must consent to, and seven out of the eight women interviewed for the story told New York writer Lila Shapiro that they had no interest in BDSM but at some point played along. Advertisement Gaiman, through his representatives, told the magazine that the encounters  were all consensual. Then, in a lengthy statement posted Tuesday on his website , the “Good Omens” writer-producer said  he has watched with “horror and dismay” as stories about him circulated online over many months. He said  he stayed quiet until now “both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation.” “I’ve always tried to be a private person, and felt increasingly that social media was the wrong place to talk about important personal matters. I’ve now reached the point where I feel that I should say something,” he wrote. “As I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don’t, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. I’m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.” The “Beowulf” and “Coraline” screenwriter said he  re-read messages he had exchanged with some of the women, particularly  communication that had been reported as abusive. The messages, he said, “read now as they did when I received them — of two people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships and wanting to see one another again. At the time I was in those relationships, they seemed positive and happy on both sides.” Advertisement Books Getting to know Neil Gaiman The prolific British writer offers a glimpse of himself — sort of — as a Sussex boy in his latest novel, ‘The Ocean at the End of the Lane.’ June 13, 2013 Gaiman also conceded that he “could have and should have done so much better.” “I was emotionally unavailable while being sexually available, self-focused and not as thoughtful as I could or should have been. I was obviously careless with people’s hearts and feelings, and that’s something that I really, deeply regret. It was selfish of me. I was caught up in my own story and I ignored other people’s,” he wrote. The author said  he has spent months taking a long, hard look  at himself and how he has made people feel, noting that he’s learning, “trying to do the work needed” and growing. “I understand that not everyone will believe me or even care what I say but I’ll be doing the work anyway, for myself, my family and the people I love. I will be doing my very best to deserve their trust, as well as the trust of my readers,” he wrote. Advertisement “At the same time, as I reflect on my past — and as I re-review everything that actually happened as opposed to what is being alleged — I don’t accept there was any abuse. To repeat, I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone,” he said. “Some of the horrible stories now being told simply never happened, while others have been so distorted from wha...",

Print The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that the much-maligned red dye No. 3 will be banned in the United States because it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. The decision, lauded by consumer advocacy groups , comes a full 25 years after scientists at the agency determined that rats fed large amounts of the artificial color additive were much more likely to develop malignant thyroid tumors than rats who weren’t given the food coloring. They also had an increased incidence of benign tumors and growths that can be precursors to cancer. Those findings prompted the FDA to declare in 1990 that red dye No. 3 could not be used in cosmetics or drugs applied to the skin. The reason for the decision was clear: A federal law known as the Delaney clause says no color additive can be considered safe if it has been shown to cause cancer in animals or people. Yet the dye remained a legal food coloring. It’s in the bright red cherries that dress up a bowl of Del Monte’s fruit cocktail . It makes Nesquik’s strawberry milk a pleasing shade of pink. It also colors beef jerky , fruit rolls , candy , ice cream and scores of other processed products . Advertisement Now food makers will have two years to reformulate their products without red dye No. 3. Drug companies have three years to remove it from their medicines. The FDA does not seem to be bothered by the fact that this cancer-causing chemical will linger in the food supply. The agency’s view is that the biological process through which the dye causes cancer in rats doesn’t occur in people. “We don’t believe there is a risk to humans,” Jim Jones , the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, told members of Congress last month. Science & Medicine How the FDA allows companies to add secret ingredients to our food The FDA allows food makers to vouch for the safety of ingredients they add to our food, calling them ‘generally recognized as safe.’ Dec. 4, 2024 In announcing the ban, the agency added that people consume red dye No. 3 at levels far lower than those shown to cause cancer in two studies of rats. A host of other studies in both animals and humans did not show the dye to be cancerous. Nonetheless, regulators revoked authorization of red dye No. 3 to satisfy a petition demanding that the Delaney clause be enforced. Starburst-flavored Fruit by the Foot, which contains red dye No. 3. (Christina House / Los Angeles Times) Advertisement “Regardless of the truth behind their argument, it doesn’t matter,” said Jensen N. Jose , regulatory counsel for food chemical safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which spearheaded the effort. “Once it’s established that it causes cancer, FDA must prohibit the chemical by law.” This wasn’t the first case of the FDA banning a food additive it considers safe to comply with the Delaney clause. The situation shows why the federal law is long overdue for a refresh, food safety experts say. “A lot of people think we need to reform this,” said Diana Winters , deputy director of the Resnick Center for Food Law and Policy at UCLA Law. “It does lead to some absurd results.” The Delaney clause is part of a 1958 federal law that expanded the FDA’s regulatory authority over newfangled food additives developed during World War II that were making their way into consumer products, Winters said. Back then, members of Congress were worried about the cancer risks posed by all sorts of man-made compounds. Even small amounts seemed capable of triggering cancerous growths if people encountered them over and over again. Arthur Flemming, who served as President Eisenhower’s Cabinet secretary for health and welfare, told Congress at the time there was no way for FDA regulators to know whether any exposure level was low enough to be truly safe. Considering the many cancer risks lurking in the environment, he said, the government should “do everything possible to put persons in a position where they will not unnecessarily be adding residues of carcinogens to their diet.” Advertisement Signature Select rainbow cups, which contain red dye No. 3. (Christina House / Los Angeles Times) The issue was personal for Rep. James Delaney, a Democrat from New York City whose wife was undergoing cancer treatment at the time. He made sure the new law included a zero-tolerance provision for cancer-causing substances, though it said nothing about additives that might cause other kinds of health problems. “No additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal, or if it is found, after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of food additives, to induce cancer in man or animal,” the Delaney clause states.

Rubio, with extensive experience on Capitol Hill and in foreign policy circles, appears to be the least controversial in Trump’s list of Cabinet picks, many of whom lack the credentials or background usually associated with their nominated jobs. A foreign policy hawk — especially on China — Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, seemed likely to win easy bipartisan approval. On Wednesday, he faced the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee on which he has served for 14 years. Advertisement If confirmed as expected, Rubio will be the first Latino to serve as America’s top diplomat. In the past, Rubio largely hewed to long-standing Republican views on a multi-lateral approach to the world, embracing allies and united action. On Wednesday,  he echoed Trump’s “America first” philosophy. His State Department, Rubio testified, will be guided by a singular objective “to promote peace abroad, and security and prosperity here at home.” Advertisement “Placing our core national interests above all else is not isolationism,” Rubio said. “The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us.” China, he said, is the “most potent” enemy the United States has ever faced, its “near peer” on many fronts, including technology, economy and diplomatic muscle. “We’ve allowed them to get away with things .... and now we are dealing with the ramifications of that,” he said, advocating the U.S. must fortify its own industrial and supply chain capabilities to prevent “total dependence ... from our security to our health” on the communist-led nation. Advertisement Rubio, who recently voted against an aid package for Ukraine, echoed Trump in saying Kyiv’s war with Russia had to come to an end. “There will have to be concessions made” by both Russia and Ukraine, he said. Many observers worry that Trump’s affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to him demanding more sacrifice from Ukraine in any peace negotiation. The hearing was interrupted by protesters; Rubio quipped that at least he gets bilingual demonstrators. But overall, the mood among the senators was friendly and lacked the confrontations of the previous day’s hearing of Fox TV commentator Pete Hegseth, whom Trump has nominated to be secretary of Defense.

Print WASHINGTON — More than 15 months into Israel’s devastating war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the two sides have agreed to a cease-fire deal that would pause fighting and free some Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, U.S. and Qatari officials said Wednesday. “At long last, I can announce a cease-fire, and a hostage deal, has been reached between Israel and Hamas,” President Biden said from the White House. The guidelines of the hard-fought agreement were first presented by Biden last spring, but months of negotiations repeatedly failed to bring the two enemies together. Advertisement The cease-fire, which begins Sunday, starts with a six-week period during which fighting stops and hostages are released. During that period negotiations for a permanent end to the war will commence, Biden said. “After 15 months of terror ... hostages will go home,” the president said. “And the Palestinian people have gone through hell. Too many people have died.” Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani, first announced the deal at a news conference in the Qatari capital, Doha. “We hope this will be the last page in these times of war,” he said. “We tell our brothers in Gaza, we will always support the Palestinian people.” Advertisement U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators spent months holding extensive rounds of talks with Israeli and Hamas leaders to broker what the parties hope will bring at least a partial end to a conflict that has left more than 46,000 Palestinians dead, at least half of them women and children, Palestinian officials estimate. Unusually, teams representing the Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump worked together to secure the deal and joined the other mediators. “We’ve been speaking as one team,” Biden said. The war — which destabilized the Middle East and unleashed protests across the U.S. — began Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, invaded southern Israel, killed more than 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped some 250 others. Most of the victims were civilians. Advertisement Israel immediately launched a relentless barrage of airstrikes and ground attacks that destroyed most of the coastal enclave’s houses, buildings, hospitals and infrastructure, bringing many survivors to the brink of starvation. Under the deal, Israel and Hamas agree to an initial six-week halt to fighting. About a third of the 100 hostages remaining would be freed and as many as 1,000 Palestinians held by Israel would be released. A previous group of hostages and prisoners was released in November 2023. Notably, Israeli troops will not withdraw from the Gaza Strip but will retreat from populated areas. The more than 1 million Palestinians who have been displaced will be allowed to return — though only rubble awaits many — and humanitarian aid that has been partly blocked by Israel will be allowed to enter the strip. Sick and wounded Gazans will be helped to leave for medical care. Israel believes that about 34 of the 100 remaining hostages in Gaza are dead. Those to be released are mostly older people, women, children and the infirm. Soldiers would not yet be released. Biden proposed the framework for the cease-fire in May. It’s been delayed by both sides. Hamas has not wanted to accept anything short of a full end of Israeli occupation of and attacks on Gaza. Israel has refused to withdraw from the territory until it deems Hamas has been destroyed. Trump inauguration next week may have increased pressure. He has said publicly he wanted to see hostages released before he takes office and signaled he would not hold back Israel. Advertisement The deal still faces obstacles. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet must approve it, and given the far-right, recalcitrant members of that group, approval is not guaranteed. Interjecting a note of caution, Netanyahu said Wednesday that not all details of the agreement — expected to be voted on Thursday by the Cabinet — had yet been settled. “Several items in the framework have yet to be finalized,” his office said in a statement Wednesday night. Still, the Israeli leader — who has worked assiduously throughout the conflict to placate hard-line elements of his coalition — claimed credit for wringing final concessions from Hamas. His office said the prime minister’s “firm stance” had resulted in a last-minute agreement by the militant group regarding the deployment of Israeli forces in a narrow border strip dividing Gaza from Egypt.

Round One inadvertently pushed China and Mexico closer together on trade and foreign investment, as China sought new trade partners and a detour for its exports to reach the U.S. This time Trump has taken aim not only at China but also at Mexico and other Latin American countries. Advertisement The Times spoke with John Polga-Hecimovich, an associate professor of political science at the U.S. Naval Academy, who argues that the new Trump administration could shift the balance of power among China, the U.S. and Latin America. How have the relationships between Latin America, China and the U.S. changed over the last two decades? Latin American governments are starting to see China as really a viable economic alternative to the United States. In the early 2000s, a bunch of left-wing governments came to power in what was called “the pink tide.” China sought out those governments, and those governments sought out China. Then governments from the center and the right saw the success that those left-wing governments had, and they, too, turned to China. Advertisement World & Nation How Trump tariff threats might plunge Mexico into recession and stoke immigration Few countries would be more affected than Mexico by Trump’s threats to enact sweeping tariffs on imports. They could lead to more poverty, migration, some economists say. Oct. 27, 2024 The U.S. response to this has been unfocused, to put it charitably. China’s economic ascension was driven by its interest in securing resources during the commodities boom. And with its global geopolitical ambitions, it certainly makes sense that China would have a long-term strategy in the region. Whereas the U.S. strategy has ping-ponged from [Presidents] Obama to Trump to Biden to this  [incoming] Trump administration. The U.S. has been the undisputed economic hegemon in Latin America for most of the region’s post-independence history. But over the last two decades, China really displaced the United States as the region’s top trading partner. Mexico is the big regional exception. How did Trump’s first term affect that dynamic? Since 2016, bilateral trade between China and Mexico increased enormously. China is now Mexico’s second-largest trading partner after the United States. Advertisement Part of the story is China very smartly using Mexico as a launching pad to get its goods into the United States, basically tariff-free. The majority of Mexico’s industrial activity is located in the northern part of the country: Baja California, Tijuana, Chihuahua state, Monterrey. They have these robust logistics networks and these major manufacturing hubs. That’s where Chinese companies have relocated. The Chinese have taken advantage of the post-COVID environment to essentially move their businesses to a country that “near-shores” to the United States. This allows Chinese companies and U.S. consumers to save on shipping costs and tariffs. The final products being made are considered completely “Mexican.” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks during a meeting with Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing in July 2019. (Mark Schiefelbein / Associated Press) So the question is: How will the Trump administration respond to this? Will it try to renegotiate elements of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement? Trump has said he wants to slap a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico and Canada. That would ruin the U.S. economy . I don’t know if that is bluster for negotiation purposes, or if he’s willfully ignorant, or both. How has Biden addressed the growing ties between China and Mexico? Biden has not dismantled the tariffs against China that Trump put into place. I think rather than taking a stick approach, the Biden administration has taken more of a carrot approach when it comes to Mexico and what the U.S. wants out of it, which is cooperation on migration and security issues, in narcotics trafficking and especially fentanyl . So I think that trade falls a lot further down the list for the Biden administration than it would for the Trump administration. World & Nation Trump is threatening to raise tariffs again.

Print WASHINGTON — After years of debate, the Biden administration has notified Congress that it will remove Cuba from the U.S. list of states that sponsor terrorism, a label given the island nation in the last days of the previous Trump presidency. The decision Tuesday was part of an agreement brokered in part by the Roman Catholic Church to free political prisoners held in Cuba, U.S. officials said. There is “no credible evidence at this time of ongoing support by Cuba of international terrorism,” a senior administration official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Advertisement Cuba always seemed an odd member of the notorious club , which included Syria and Iran. Most experts and observers of the communist-led nation contended that it did not participate in global terrorism equivalent to the alleged actions of other nations. World & Nation It was once the capital of Iran’s ‘axis of resistance.’ Now a Syrian town grapples with its future The Syrian shrine of Sayeda Zainab drew Iran-backed militiamen from throughout the region. With Assad’s fall, they’ve fled, raising questions about the future of the area — and of the axis. Jan. 8, 2025 Former Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo , in his final week in office under then-President Trump, put Cuba on the list, with little explanation. Being on the “state sponsor of terrorism” list is the blackest of designations for any country. Many Cuba experts assumed President Biden, once in office, would reverse the designation. Biden, after all, was vice president during President Obama’s historic opening of ties with Cuba in 2015, reestablishing diplomatic relations and approving numerous trade and travel exchanges. Obama famously traveled to Havana, the first U.S. president to do so in a century, and attended a baseball game with then-President Raul Castro. Advertisement Yet, as the years passed, Biden did not move on the Cuba issue . Advocates for better relations protested steadily. The Times repeatedly asked the State Department why no action was being taken and was told that removal from the list was more complicated than being added to it, and required a more thorough examination. It is unclear now that such a thorough examination took place. “In taking these steps to bolster the ongoing dialogue between the government of Cuba and the Catholic Church, President Biden is also honoring the wisdom and counsel that has been provided to him by many world leaders, especially in Latin America, who have encouraged him to take these actions, on how best to advance the human rights of the Cuban people,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Advertisement The Roman Catholic Church has relatively good relations with the Cuban government. U.S. officials said the deal could result in the release of “dozens” of political prisoners, many detained for relatively minor infractions such as protesting in the streets or posting material deemed offensive to the government. Human rights groups say several hundred people have been jailed by Cuban authorities for a variety of supposed infractions. Politics News Analysis: Carter, during and after presidency, changed way world saw the U.S. — often for the better He brought human rights to forefront in foreign policy, laid security foundations that have endured. Jan. 9, 2025 Havana welcomed Biden’s move, with reservations. “This is a decision that points in the right direction,” the Cuban Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Cuba has long demanded an end of the U.S. embargo that officials there say cuts off food, supplies, trade and other business. It is unclear how long this new status will last. Trump, who takes office again next week, has tapped Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as his secretary of State, and he is likely to be approved. Rubio, son of Cuban immigrants, is expected to take an especially hard line on Cuba and might quickly attempt to reverse the terrorism designation. Trump has also appointed Mauricio Claver-Carone, a former White House National Security Council aide who also supports tough sanctions against Cuba, to be his special envoy to Latin America.

Print TAIPEI, Taiwan — TikTok users concerned about a possible ban are finding solace in a strange place. Days ahead of a Supreme Court decision that could determine whether the popular short-video app shuts down starting Sunday, a number of users appear to be turning to an app called RedNote — more commonly known to its majority-Chinese audience by its Chinese name, Xiaohongshu. It’s a surprising choice since Xiaohongshu is Chinese-owned, and such ties are the reason U.S. lawmakers moved to ban TikTok in the U.S., citing privacy and national security concerns. Also, Xiaohongshu is dominated by Chinese language, and its content is subject to censorship by Chinese government officials, something alien to most U.S. users. Advertisement But by embracing a Chinese social media and lifestyle app similar to Instagram, some U.S. TikTok users say they are protesting what they believe would be an unfair ban of the ubiquitous app. “I think America is trying to bully China into selling to an American owner. A lot of us just don’t want to give in to them,” said Samantha Manassero, a 39-year-old nurse in L.A. who downloaded Xiaohongshu on Sunday night after watching content creators on TikTok pitch it as a comparable app. “I think some of it is literally just pettiness.” Last year, Congress passed a bill that requires TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, to sell the app to a U.S.-approved owner or face a nationwide ban. As soon as Wednesday, the Supreme Court is expected to uphold the legality of the ban. Advertisement It was unclear whether Xiaohongshu, which was started in 2013, would become a viable alternative to TikTok or if the recent migration to the Chinese platform accounts for a significant share of TikTok’s 170 million U.S. users. But a surge in new users made Xiaohongshu the top free download on Apple’s App Store this week. No. 2 on the charts was another social media app developed by ByteDance,  Lemon8. It’s unclear whether either app will be subjected to the same U.S. government scrutiny as TikTok. It is also difficult to determine exactly how many U.S. TikTok users have created accounts on Xiaohongshu or how many will stay on it. While many Xiaohongshu regulars have welcomed the influx of Americans identifying themselves as “TikTok refugees,” the app’s interface is largely in Chinese, making it difficult to navigate for non-native speakers. Advertisement Chinese apps are subject to stringent censorship on discussions that the Chinese government deems politically sensitive. These topics can include illegal activities, LGBTQ+ rights and Winnie the Pooh, images of which have been used to mock Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Chinese version of TikTok, called Douyin, has different content restrictions and is available only for mobile download in China. ByteDance has argued that TikTok, which is used by the rest of the world, is a separate entity from Douyin and not beholden to the Chinese Communist Party. That did not stop President-elect Donald Trump from proposing a ban of TikTok in 2020, or President Biden from signing it into law in 2024. The legality of such a ban has been questioned several times. Last month, in an about-face, Trump, who has 14.8 million followers on TikTok, filed a legal brief requesting to stay the ban so he can negotiate a deal once he takes office. As TikTok faces an uncertain future, Xiaohongshu’s latest arrivals were eager to try out the new app despite its foreign nature. Manassero, who posts videos about healthcare and power lifting to about 7,000 followers on TikTok, said she has a much larger audience of 26,000 on Instagram. However, she was motivated to create an account on Xiaohongshu partly out of frustration at the U.S. government’s determination to outlaw TikTok. Advertisement “I don’t know what I’m doing, I don’t know what I’m reading, I’m just pressing buttons,” Manassero said in her first video post. The next morning, her account had received 5,000 views and 3,500 new followers. By Tuesday, the hashtag “#Tiktok refugee” had received more than 90 million views and 2 million comments. TikTokers have sought out one another with introductions, followed requests and shared tips on how to navigate the app’s Chinese functions. On Monday, more than 190,000 viewers joined a live chat named the TikTok Refugees Club, and held discussions in English about what a TikTok ban would mean and future plans for social media content. In the comments, users greeted new arrivals and lamented they could not understand each other. “Maybe you can learn how to speak Chinese,” one user wrote in English. “Where’s the tr...",

Print The Republican-led bill mandates federal detention for immigrants who are charged with minor crimes and grants broad enforcement powers to states. It passed the House with 48 Democrats in support. Among them were seven Democrats from California. WASHINGTON — The Senate this week is considering the Laken Riley Act , a Republican-led bill that mandates federal detention for immigrants who are charged with minor crimes and grants broad enforcement powers to states. It passed the House earlier this month as the first bill taken up by the new, Republican-controlled Congress and moved forward in the Senate with significant support from Democrats. The bill’s advancement illustrates the new willingness by more Democrats to consider conservative immigration policies after losing favor with voters on border security, a front-line issue in the November presidential election. Advertisement Immigrant rights groups and other opponents have warned that the bill would violate due process rights and be extremely costly to the federal government. What happened to Laken Riley? The bill is named for Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed last year in Athens, Ga., by a Venezuelan immigrant who had entered the U.S. illegally in 2022. Border Patrol agents released him, like many migrants, with temporary permission to stay in the country. Jose Antonio Ibarra, 26, had previously been cited in Georgia with misdemeanor shoplifting from Walmart and was arrested in New York for driving a scooter without a license and with a child who wasn’t wearing a helmet. Supporters of the bill say federal authorities should have detained Ibarra after he was charged with those crimes. Advertisement In November, Ibarra was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Allyson and John Phillips, Riley’s mother and stepfather, wrote in a statement that the bill has their full support. “Laken would have been 23 on January 10th,” they wrote. “There is no greater gift that could be given to her and our country than to continue her legacy by saving lives through this bill.” Advertisement What would the Laken Riley Act do? The Laken Riley Act has three significant provisions: to require detention of immigrants convicted of certain crimes; to authorize state governments to sue the federal government over its handling of individual immigrants; and to give states the power to demand that the State Department stop issuing visas for countries that refuse to accept the return of deported nationals. “If you came into the U.S. illegally and then you chose to commit a crime against Americans — whether that’s against persons or property — on U.S. soil, you should go to the front of line when it comes to detention and removal,” Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.), who introduced the Senate bill, wrote on X . The bill would require immigration agents to take into custody people who have been arrested for burglary, theft, larceny or shoplifting. It would override the current discretion afforded to federal officials to prioritize the detention of people with violent criminal records. The legislation requires detention if a person is even charged with theft-related crimes. That means someone could be deported before getting the chance to defend themselves in court. The bill also enables state attorneys general to sue the U.S. government over alleged mishandling of people in its custody, overriding the long-standing broad federal authority over immigration matters. State officials could get a court to instruct immigration agents to track down people it had released from detention. States would also be empowered to insert themselves into U.S. foreign policy matters. Some countries refuse to accept back their citizens whom the U.S. attempts to deport. The bill would allow state attorneys general to sue the State Department to stop visas from being issued for any country refusing to accept deportations. Advertisement What are the political and legal ramifications? Opponents say the law would lead to chaos in federal courts and the separation of longtime residents from their U.S. citizen family members as they are detained indefinitely. “I don’t think that people understood what was in the bill when they were co-sponsoring it,” said Kerri Talbot, executive director of the advocacy group Immigration Hub, who works with Congress to develop policy. Jason Houser, who was chief of staff for Immigration and Customs Enforcement from 2021 to 2023, said the legislation would force federal agencies to divert personnel from the most dangerous offenders. “If this bill is enacted, you will see less individuals in detention that are violent convicted crimina...",

Print After battling cancer most of last year, Kate Middleton says she’s now in remission. Catherine, Princess of Wales, who confirmed last March that she had cancer after months of speculation about her health and well-being, said Tuesday that she is focused on recovery. “It is a relief to now be in remission and I remain [focused] on recovery,” she said in a statement posted on social media. “As anyone who has experienced a cancer diagnosis will know, it takes time to adjust to a new normal. I am however looking forward to a fulfilling year ahead. Thank you to everyone for your continued support.” Catherine, Princess of Wales, and husband Prince William, who is first in line to the British throne, on Tuesday were named joint patrons of the Royal Marsden — the cancer hospital where Catherine received treatment last year. Since 2007, William has been president of the Royal Marsden, a  position that was held previously by his mother, the late Princess Diana. Advertisement Entertainment & Arts Kate Middleton has completed cancer treatment, will return to light public duties Catherine, Princess of Wales, says she has completed her chemotherapy treatment for cancer and plans to undertake light engagements through the end of the year. Sept. 9, 2024 “I wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you to The Royal Marsden for looking after me so well during the past year,” Catherine said in her statement. “My heartfelt thanks goes to all those who have quietly walked alongside William and me as we have navigated everything. We couldn’t have asked for more. The care and advice we have received throughout my time as a patient has been exceptional.” In her new role, the 43-year-old princess said she hopes to save more lives and transform the experience of all those affected  by cancer by supporting groundbreaking research and clinical excellence, as well as promoting patient and family well-being. Catherine’s health issues and the royal missteps that followed became a global topic of discussion early last year when Kensington Palace announced that she had to take a break from royal duties after having “major abdominal surgery” in January. Rampant speculation ran amok about the princess’ retreat from the public eye, fueling months of broad concern about her condition and whereabouts . Advertisement In March, she made the cancer announcement in a poignant video message that came in the wake of reports that her medical records at the London Clinic were allegedly breached by hospital staffers. She began treatment in late February and announced in September that she had completed it , confirming that she would soon return to light public duties. Entertainment & Arts Don’t blame the public for failing Kate Middleton. Blame the palace Many will shame royal watchers for speculating about the Princess of Wales’ health. But catastrophic missteps by the royal communications apparatus created this mess. March 22, 2024 The announcement of Catherine’s patronage was made Tuesday during her visit to the Royal Marsden’s hospital in Chelsea. There, the mother of three met with patients being treated with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. “We were honoured to welcome Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales to The Royal Marsden in Chelsea this morning, and are delighted that Her Royal Highness is now joining His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales in becoming Joint Patrons of our specialist cancer centre,” said Cally Palmer, chief executive of the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. Advertisement Palmer said William has been “a wonderful supporter of our work for nearly two decades” and that his and Catherine’s royal patronage is inspiring for staff and patients and “enables us to shine a light on the outstanding work our staff deliver every day for patients and their families.” During her Tuesday visit, Catherine disclosed some of the side effects she experienced after her cancer treatment, including speech issues and brain fog. “You think treatment’s finished, crack on with that … daily tasks, but that’s still like a real challenge,” she told hospital staff, according to the Daily Mail . “And talking … the words totally disappear … understanding that as a patient, yes, there are side effects around treatment, but actually there are more long-term side effects.” More to Read Prince William says Kate Middleton’s ‘doing really well’ after cancer treatment Nov. 6, 2024 The Princess of Wales is back to work at Windsor Castle after finishing chemotherapy Sept. 18, 2024 Princess Anne returns to her royal duties after recovery from concussion July 12, 2024",

Print WASHINGTON — Special counsel Jack Smith said his team “stood up for the rule of law” as it investigated President-elect Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, writing in a much-anticipated report released Tuesday that he stands fully behind his decision to bring criminal charges that he believes would have resulted in a conviction had voters not returned Trump to the White House. “The throughline of all of Mr. Trump’s criminal efforts was deceit — knowingly false claims of election fraud — and the evidence shows that Mr. Trump used these lies as a weapon to defeat a federal government function foundational to the United States’ democratic process,” the report states. The report, arriving just days before Trump is to return to office on Monday, focuses fresh attention on the Republican’s frantic but failed effort to cling to power in 2020 after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. With the prosecution foreclosed thanks to Trump’s 2024 election victory, the document is expected to be the final Justice Department chronicle of a dark chapter in American history that threatened to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, a bedrock of democracy for centuries, and complements already released indictments and reports. Advertisement Trump responded early Tuesday with a post on his social media platform, claiming he was “totally innocent” and calling Smith “a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election.” He added, “THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN!!!” Trump had been indicted in August 2023 on charges of working to overturn the election, but the case was delayed by appeals and ultimately significantly narrowed by a conservative-majority Supreme Court that held for the first time that former presidents enjoy sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. That decision, Smith’s report states, left open unresolved legal issues that would probably have required another trip to the Supreme Court for the case to have moved forward. Smith’s team dismissed the indictment after the November election because of long-standing Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution. “But for Mr. Trump’s election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,” the report states. Advertisement The Justice Department transmitted the report to Congress early Tuesday after a judge refused a defense effort to block its release. A separate volume of the report focused on Trump’s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida , actions that formed the basis of a separate indictment against Trump, will remain under wraps for now. Smith’s report accuses Trump of an “unprecedented criminal effort to overturn the legitimate results of the election in order to retain power.” It recounts his role in trying to force the Justice Department to use its law enforcement authorities to advance his personal interests, participating in a scheme to enlist fake electors in battleground states won by Biden and having directed “an angry mob to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election and then leverage rioters’ violence to further delay it.” Advertisement And it documents his fallout with his vice president, Mike Pence, over Trump’s demands that he refuse to certify the electoral count before Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. It says that just before he left the White House to deliver a speech at the Ellipse, Trump called Pence one last time. After the vice president told him he planned to issue a public statement that he lacked the authority to do what the president demanded, Trump “directed staffers to re-insert into his planned Ellipse speech some language that he had drafted earlier targeting Mr. Pence,” the report says. Though most of the details of Trump’s efforts to undo the election are already well established, the document includes for the first time a detailed assessment from Smith about his investigation, as well as a defense by Smith against criticism by Trump and his allies that the inquiry was politicized or that he worked in collaboration with the White House — an assessment he called “laughable.” “While we were not able to bring the cases we charged to trial, I believe the fact that our team stood up for the rule of law matters,” Smith wrote in a letter to Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland attached to the report. “I believe the example our team set for others to fight for justice without regard for the personal costs matter...",

Print WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court dealt a major setback to the oil industry Monday, refusing to block lawsuits from California and other blue states that seek billions of dollars in damages for the effects of climate change. Without a comment or dissent, the justices turned down closely watched appeals from Sunoco, Shell and other energy producers. In Sunoco vs. Honolulu, the oil industry urged the justices to intervene in these state cases and rule that because climate change is a global phenomenon, it is a matter for federal law only, not one suited to state-by-state claims. Advertisement “The stakes could not be higher,” they told the court. But none of the justices said they wanted to hear their claim, at least not now. The decision clears the way for more than two dozen suits filed by states and municipalities to move forward and try to prove their claim that the major oil producers knew of the potential damage of burning fossil fuels but chose to conceal it. “Big Oil companies keep fighting a losing battle to avoid standing trial for their climate lies,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity. “With this latest denial, the fossil fuel industry’s worst nightmare — having to face the overwhelming evidence of their decades of calculated climate deception — is closer than ever to becoming a reality.” Two years ago, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior Court against five of the largest oil and gas companies — Exxon Mobil, Shell, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and BP — and the American Petroleum Institute for what they described as a “decades-long campaign of deception” that created climate-related harms in California. Advertisement “For more than 50 years, Big Oil has been lying to us — covering up the fact that they’ve long known how dangerous the fossil fuels they produce are for our planet,” Newsom said in announcing the suit . In recent days, California officials have blamed climate change for the devastating weather conditions that contributed to the deadly wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes and other structures, leading to what many experts expect to become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. California’s suit followed the pattern set by similar claims from the cities of Baltimore, New York, Chicago and San Francisco as well as blue states including Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Minnesota. Advertisement These suits argue that the oil producers used deceptive marketing to hide the danger of burning fossil fuels. Under state law, companies can be held liable for failing to warn consumers of a known danger. In June 2024, the court asked the Justice Department to weigh in on the issue. In December, lawyers for the Biden administration urged the court to stand aside for now because the suits are at an early stage. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said he took no part in the decision to deny the appeals, presumably because he owns stock in companies affected by the dispute. World & Nation U.S. Supreme Court will decide if oil industry may sue to block California’s zero-emissions goal Supreme Court will consider whether oil industry may sue to challenge California’s plan to require ‘zero emissions’ for new vehicles by 2035. Dec. 15, 2024 The climate change lawsuits were patterned after the successful mass lawsuits filed by states and others against the tobacco industry over cigarettes and the pharmaceutical industry over opioids. Cigarettes and opioids were sold legally, but the suits alleged that industry officials conspired to deceive the public and hide the true dangers of their highly profitable products. Under state law, plaintiffs can seek damages for broad and open-ended claims such as a failure to warn of a danger, false advertising or creating a public nuisance. All three claims are cited in California’s lawsuit. Federal law, by contrast, is usually limited to damage claims that are authorized by Congress. Advertisement Had the Supreme Court agreed to hear the oil industry’s appeal in the Hawaii case, it “would have frozen the cases for a year or more and could have resulted in a death blow for all of them,” said Patrick Parenteau, an environmental law expert at the Vermont Law School. Los Angeles lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who represents Chevron, said the company “will continue to defend against meritless state law climate litigation, which clashes with basic constitutional principles, undermines sound energy policy.” Meanwhile, Alabama and 20 red states urged the court to throw out these blue-state lawsuits.

His threats against less powerful countries reflect the principles of Trump’s worldview, factors that will likely make his second-term foreign policy chaotic and destabilizing. And the irony is that Trump’s bullying approach has already backfired. WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s campaign excursions into foreign policy were few and far between. He promised to build a stronger military and keep the country out of war. He said he would bring peace to Gaza and end the war in Ukraine on “day one,” never offering details. Last week, Trump waded boldly into global affairs — but he barely touched on those purported priorities. Instead, at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, he focused on a list of obscure, arguably eccentric goals: acquiring Greenland from Denmark , absorbing Canada as a very large 51st state , and retaking control of the Panama Canal. The president-elect said he would bring all three territories under U.S. control through economic coercion, but did not rule out using force to seize Greenland and the canal . Advertisement It sounded like a revival of 19th century gunboat imperialism, or at least a throwback to the global system that dominated before World War II — “spheres of influence,” in which great powers dominated their regions and smaller countries knuckled under. As so often with Trump, it was hard to know whether to take him seriously. Politics ‘All hell will break out’: 3 foreign policy takeaways from Trump Trump promised ‘all hell will break out’ in the Middle East if Israeli hostages are not returned by the time he takes office. Jan. 7, 2025 After all, he also pronounced that he will give the Gulf of Mexico a new name , the “Gulf of America” — presumably under a hitherto unknown presidential power as renamer-in-chief. And he didn’t raise the prospect of invading Greenland or Panama unprompted. Reporters at his news conference asked if he would rule out the use of force — a question he almost invariably answers, no matter what the context, with “no.” Advertisement World & Nation What’s in a name? Gulf of America? Mexican America? Mexico’s president pokes fun at Trump’s suggestion to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Jan. 8, 2025 Still, his saber- and tariff-rattling deserves to be taken seriously. Trump’s threats against less powerful countries reflect the basic principles of Trump’s worldview, factors that will likely make his second-term foreign policy chaotic and destabilizing. He likes to throw his weight around, often by slapping tariffs on other countries. In his first term, he threatened to blow up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada until both countries agreed to modest changes — which the president then trumpeted as a historic success. He’s trying the same gambit now to muscle Denmark into giving him Greenland . He has never embraced the idea of a “rules-based international order,” a system that subjects great powers and small countries alike to prohibitions on invading or coercing their neighbors. Building such an order has been a central goal of U.S. foreign policy since World War II, when Germany and Japan sought to dominate Europe and East Asia by force. Advertisement One element of that order has been a U.S.-devised system of military alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump thinks it’s a scam devised by foreigners to swindle Americans into defending them. “They want protection,” he complained last fall. “They don’t pay us money for the protection, you know. The mob makes you pay money, right?” World & Nation Column: Biden’s legacy, like Jimmy Carter’s, is complex — and it’s in Donald Trump’s hands now Jimmy Carter showed that presidents seen as failures on leaving can be viewed generously years later. What about Biden? His legacy is in Trump’s hands. Jan. 6, 2025 Canada and Denmark, as members of NATO, shouldn’t have to worry about the United States scheming to grab any of their territory — but for the next four years, they will. Another element of the rules-based order is the principle of self-determination, under which the citizens of a country have the right to decide who rules them. Trump apparently never heard of it. He never even paused to ask Greenlanders, Canadians or Panamanians whether they want the United States to move in. The irony is that Trump’s bullyboy approach has already backfired. Take his ambition for a stronger U.S. presence in Greenland. It’s not a crazy idea; the island, which lies along Arctic sea lanes and holds vast reserves of oil and rare earth minerals, would be a major strategic asset. And the impoverished...",

Print Requirements for building permits and reviews in the California Environmental Quality Act and the California Coastal Act will be eased for victims of the fires in Pacific Palisades, Altadena and other communities. Newsom called for a California version of the Marshall Plan, the American effort to rebuild Western Europe after World War II. Landmark California environmental laws will be suspended for wildfire victims seeking to rebuild their homes and businesses , according to an executive order signed Sunday by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Requirements for building permits and reviews in the California Environmental Quality Act and the California Coastal Act — often considered onerous by developers — will be eased for victims of the fires in Pacific Palisades, Altadena and other communities, according to the order. “California leads the nation in environmental stewardship. I’m not going to give that up,” Newsom told Jacob Soboroff on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “But one thing I won’t give into is delay. Delay is denial for people: lives, traditions, places torn apart, torn asunder.” Advertisement Dan Dunmoyer, president and chief executive of the California Building Industry Assn., said the governor’s action represents an early and strong statement about the future of these areas. Newsom is making clear, Dunmoyer said, that the state will encourage homeowners to go back to their neighborhoods rather than deem development there too risky. “He’s put a marker down to say we’re going to rebuild these communities,” Dunmoyer said. Waivers of the environmental quality act, known as CEQA, and the Coastal Act could shave years off the process for homeowners in the Palisades, he said, but building permits issued by local governments represent another major hurdle. “Those two banner ones are important,” Dunmoyer said, referring to the state laws, “but if the locals don’t come up with an expedited process, that’s where it could get stuck.” Advertisement Newsom’s order calls for the state housing department to work with affected cities and the county to develop new permitting rules that would allow for all approvals to be issued within 30 days. Read Newsom’s executive order Jan. 12, 2025 In the wake of the fires, housing analysts have renewed calls for the city of Los Angeles to speed up its processes. A 2023 study found that the average unit in a multifamily property in the city took five years to complete, with a substantial portion of that time related to bureaucratic approval. Mayor Karen Bass has acknowledged the problems and pledged that the city will accelerate permitting. Advertisement “We are going to clear the red tape and unnecessary delays and costs and headaches that people experience in ordinary times so that we can rebuild your homes quickly,” Bass said at a news conference Thursday. Bass reiterated the promise at a news conference Sunday morning, applauding the governor’s action, and said she plans to release details on the effort this week. L.A. County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger, who represents Altadena, similarly lauded the governor’s executive order. “I want to thank the governor for hearing my request and taking swift action to ensure that our residents will not be burdened by unnecessary requirements as they begin the process of recovery and rebuilding,” said Barger, a Republican. However, many GOP members across the state said Newsom’s order was too little, too late. California In the ruins of Palisades fire, confronting my elusive Malibu life Times reporter James Rainey ventured back to see if his childhood home in Malibu was still standing, while he reflected on ‘Old World Malibu.’ Jan. 12, 2025 “Wildfire victims deserve much more from Gavin Newsom. When his track record includes lying about and underfunding wildfire prevention efforts, he owes Angelenos answers on how he and local Democrat leaders could have been so unprepared for these devastating wildfires,” said California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson. “No more blame game and excuses. We need accountability from this governor, and we need it now.” Environmentalists also noted that the governor’s executive order restates an existing provision in the Coastal Act that provides exemptions for fire rebuilds. The California Coastal Commission, which is tasked with coordinating with local officials in enforcing the Coastal Act, noted last week that the state law already clearly lays out that reconstruction of homes, businesses and most other structures destroyed by a disaster are exempt from typical coastal development permits — as long as the new building is sited in the same location and not more...",

So at Garland’s confirmation hearing, a bar official gave senators samples of the unanimous praise from hundreds of lawyers, judges and law professors who were contacted by the group’s evaluators. “He may be the perfect human being,” effused one anonymous fan. Another: “Judge Garland has no weaknesses.” Opinion Columnist Jackie Calmes Jackie Calmes brings a critical eye to the national political scene. She has decades of experience covering the White House and Congress. Read more from Jackie Calmes Therein lies the tragedy of Merrick Garland. A man who could have been a truly supreme justice — but for then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s unprecedented Republican blockade — instead became a seemingly ineffectual attorney general, at least regarding the defining challenge of his tenure: holding Donald Trump accountable for trying to steal the 2020 presidential election. Advertisement The traits that the bar experts saw as Garland’s strengths — deliberative caution, modesty, judicial temperament, indifference to politics — turned out to be weaknesses for the head of the Justice Department in these times. So intent was Garland on restoring the department’s independence and integrity — after Trump, in his first term, openly sought to weaponize it against his enemies — that the attorney general initially shied from investigating and prosecuting Trump for his role in the postelection subversions culminating on Jan. 6, 2021. By all accounts , Garland feared the optics of the Justice Department turning its legal powers against the man President Biden had just beaten at the polls. Of course Trump, the master of projection, was going to, and did, accuse the attorney general of the very thing that Trump himself was guilty of: weaponizing the Justice Department. Yet in a nation based on the rule of law, the case against Trump needed to be pursued. Advertisement Garland succeeded in reviving the department’s post-Watergate norms, which restrict contacts between law enforcement officials and the White House, norms that Garland, as a young Justice lawyer in the Carter administration, helped develop in response to Nixon-era abuses. But so much for Garland’s achievement: Trump, saved by his election from having to answer for Jan. 6 or for a separate federal indictment for filching classified documents, will be back in power next week, more emboldened than before and backed by appointees willing to do his vengeful bidding at the Justice Department and the FBI. Last week, there were small victories for accountability, if not for Trump’s alleged federal crimes. On Friday he was sentenced for his one conviction, in New York state court in May , for falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. Judge Juan M. Merchan gave the president-elect no penalty, but at least the sentencing underscored Trump’s distinction as the only felon-president. Separately, Garland indicated he would make public the final report from special counsel Jack Smith detailing the evidence for Trump’s culpability for Jan. 6. The 72-year-old attorney general soon leaves office having angered all sides -- Republicans for going after Trump at all, Democrats for not going after him fast and hard enough. California Sen. Adam B. Schiff, formerly a member of the House Jan. 6 committee, was among the first Democrats to publicly blame the Justice Department, at least partially, for letting Trump avoid trial before the 2024 election, complaining on CNN that the department had focused too long on “the foot soldiers” who attacked the Capitol “and refrained from looking at … the inciters.” Advertisement A recent CNN retrospective on the Trump prosecution called 2021 “the lost year.” At a time when the former president was still on the defensive about Jan. 6, the Justice Department followed a bottom-up strategy targeting more than 1,500 rioters in its largest criminal investigation ever. Prosecutors insisted they were chasing leads involving Trump and close allies, while sorting out the legal complexities of trying a former occupant of the Oval Office. By 2022, questions about Garland’s deliberative dillydallying became unavoidable. In March, U.S. District Judge David O. Carter ruled in a civil case that “the illegality of the [fake electors] plan was obvious.” The next month FBI Director Christopher Wray authorized a criminal ...",

Federal aid is already flowing and will continue to arrive in L.A., but local and state officials will have their hands full for years as they work to pull the region back together, the officials said. Craig Fugate, who led the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Obama administration, has seen a lot of natural disasters. He knows the difference between destruction and utter devastation, and puts the nation’s truly cataclysmic events — those that erase entire communities in a blink — in a category all their own. The wildfires that have ravaged Los Angeles in recent days fit into that group, he said. Live Bouts of heavy rain bring flooding, mudflows “This is your Hurricane Katrina,” Fugate said in an interview with The Times. “It will forever change the community. It will be a touch point that everybody will remember, before and after. And for Los Angeles, this will become one of the defining moments of the community, the city and the county’s history.” Advertisement Many in L.A. and across California already understand the before: Bone-dry months with no rain.

FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate with President Obama in the Oval Office in 2016. (Manuel Balce Ceneta / Associated Press) Could the recovery be hampered by President-elect Donald Trump and his spat with Gov. Gavin Newsom over fire and water management in the state? Could Trump, who takes office in just over a week, unilaterally cut federal aid already promised by President Biden ? Advertisement Biden and current FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell on Friday stopped short of guaranteeing the funding would continue under Trump, with Biden saying he hoped it would. Criswell said that Biden followed the law in declaring the disaster  and that “it shouldn’t be rolled back.” Both Fugate and Peter T. Gaynor, a FEMA administrator in the first Trump administration, seemed more confident the aid would continue. “That initial assistance is locked and loaded. It’s coming,” Fugate said. “President Trump has been in office before and he’s seen disasters. He’s visited disasters. And so he knows how complicated these things are. He’s not new to this,” Gaynor said. “He’ll continue to support disaster victims no matter what state they are in or who they voted for, including in California.” But, Gaynor said, “the way forward is going to be hard — and that’s an understatement.” Fugate  agreed. He also noted that much of the path forward won’t be up to FEMA or the federal government. “There are going to be some big challenges that even the federal government is not prepared to deal with,” he said. “A lot of these decisions are going to have to be made at the local level.” The immediate challenge The scope of destruction is hard to fathom. All week, the numbers have risen — now to at least 16 dead and more than 10,000 structures damaged or destroyed. Advertisement Cost estimates have also continued to climb. JP Morgan on Thursday doubled its estimate from a day earlier, to about $50 billion, but a final total won’t be known until the true extent of the damage and reconstruction costs are known. By comparison, Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm that devastated New Orleans, killed more than 1,800 and cost about $200 billion, according to federal estimates. According to Fugate and Gaynor, the full scope of the disastrous fires won’t set in for a while — but the marching orders are clear. On Thursday,  Biden pledged that the federal government will cover 100% of disaster assistance costs to California for the next 180 days, saying, “Climate change is real.” For FEMA, they said, that means go time. “The floodgates for federal assistance are now open, and there’s a method to request and receive those resources and p...",

Print Since the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has been at war in the Middle East. The conflict has stretched across borders, spanning Gaza to Lebanon to Iran. Over the course of 15 months, the Israel Defense Forces and Israel’s intelligence services have taken the fight directly to Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, two of the most prominent members of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance.” A dramatic Israeli intelligence operation in mid-September involved exploding pagers and walkie-talkies , resulting in the death of more than a dozen Hezbollah foot soldiers, with thousands of other people in Lebanon injured or maimed. In Gaza, the Israeli military has killed more than 17,000 Hamas fighters, a devastating blow to the group’s rank and file, affecting 22 of Hamas’ 24 battalions. But the centerpiece of Israel’s efforts has been targeted assassinations , killing the leaders of these groups with ruthless efficiency. Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was taken out by an Israeli airstrike in late September, while Hamas’ leader, Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the Oct. 7 attack, was killed by the Israeli military in Rafah in mid-October. Advertisement Much of the conventional wisdom on counterterrorism, however, suggests that killing a terrorist leader — also known as decapitation strikes — is insufficient to defeat these groups over the long term. Despite that, there have been numerous scholars and analysts who have published assessments suggesting that, as the Economist opined , there is “good reason to believe that this time may be different.” Respected military historian Raphael S. Cohen added his voice to those who see Sinwar’s death as highly consequential, arguing that “this incident differs from killing al-Zarqawi, al-Baghdadi, and even bin Ladin,” in reference to the leaders of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the Islamic State and core Al Qaeda, respectively. Still, the empirical evidence and the broader body of research on the efficacy of decapitation strikes point to both Hamas and Hezbollah continuing to function, even in a significantly attenuated state, until both can recruit new members and rebuild their organizations. Advertisement One of the reasons it is premature to write the obituary of either Hamas or Hezbollah is that both groups are better understood as insurgent organizations, not transnational terrorist groups. What’s the difference? Terrorism is a tactic, while insurgency is a strategy. Terrorism consists of “ violent, criminal attacks ,” and although insurgents might use terrorism, it does not define them; an insurgency is “the organized use of subversion and violence to seize, nullify, or challenge political control of a region.” Hamas and Hezbollah have nationalist agendas interwoven with Islamist ideology, but the group’s primary members and supporters are Palestinians and Lebanese, respectively. These groups are organic and homegrown, unlike the Islamic State or Al Qaeda, which have relied heavily on fighters from abroad. This matters because foreign fighters, while zealous in many ways, are unmoored from the territory they inhabit. For most of its existence, Al Qaeda was a roving band of jihadists that traveled from battlefield to battlefield, stretching from the Balkans to the Caucasus to South Asia. At its peak , the Islamic State counted 30,000 foreign fighters from 85 countries, not including those who brought along their families. By contrast, Hamas and Hezbollah will replenish their ranks with locals — new recruits, many of whom will be catalyzed to continue their struggle after the immense devastation and humanitarian suffering wrought by Israel’s draconian approach in Gaza and Lebanon. As they have throughout their tenure, Hamas and Hezbollah will use the ongoing conflict to reinforce a cult of martyrdom in an effort to ensure that ideological and religious fervor is transmitted to younger generations. Killing leaders of the organizations does not significantly hinder this — and might even fuel radicalization. Advertisement Both Hamas and Hezbollah are part and parcel of the sociopolitical fabric in Gaza and Lebanon and will inevitably regrow their depleted ranks. Hezbollah recruits through offering jobs, education and healthcare and by providing other services to Shia in southern Lebanon. Israel’s scorched-earth approach in Gaza — where 45,000 Palestinians have been killed and the territory’s infrastructure razed to the ground — will serve as a recruiting tool for Hamas as it seeks to enlist the next wave of Palestinians, many of whom will be radicalized by the war and its aftermath. “We’ll be fight...",

Print From across the country and the globe, even casual acquaintances, distant work contacts and people we’ve never met have been checking up on us. “The world is watching, and empathizing,” says a Highland Park resident and native Angeleno. “I’m really moved by the response.” Questions abound around the wildfires still burning their way across Los Angeles, obliterating entire neighborhoods with an unfathomable speed and ferocity. What started the fires? Could we have avoided the carnage we’ve witnessed so far? Will we ever trust the evacuation notification system again, with all its false alerts, non-alerts and inconsistencies from phone to phone? But there’s been one predominant question asked of us — the residents of L.A city and county: “Are you OK?” I’ve received dozens of inquiries since the flames engulfed the Pacific Palisades and Altadena, and they continue to pop up all over the map. The notes have come from friends and family, of course, but also casual acquaintances, distant work contacts and people I’ve never even met. They’ve checked in via text, email, IMs, chats and every other way imaginable since the disaster made national and world news. Advertisement How are you? I’m watching the news about the fires in L.A. — WhatsApp message Angelenos I’ve spoken to are also receiving a multitude of check-ins. The majority are grateful for the concern, a few others find the number of inquiries overwhelming. I’m a member of the first group. I’ve never been more grateful to receive such a preponderance of unsolicited messages, and that says a lot since speed-deletion skills are a crowning achievement of my decades-long career in journalism. Advertisement Receiving those queries means we’re lucky enough to have people in or around our lives who give a toss, like a dear old friend from South Carolina who texted , Are you ok and not in the area that is getting this?

I haven’t answered everyone yet, but I will. They need to know we’re safe and that our home is still standing. But to claim we’re OK isn’t exactly the truth. We’re frazzled, stunned and above all, mourning the destruction around us. We live on the edge of the Eaton fire zone, and it’s been terrifying. Deafening, violent gusts of winds felt as if they were going to tear our roof off. Dark plumes of smoke engulfed our neighborhood. The eerie glow of flames as they crested multiple hills across from our house. Conflicting evacuation alerts, none of which was coordinated across the three phones in our household (or the dozens on our block), added confusion on top of panic. We received multiple, varying messages at different times, from evacuation warnings to a “Leave Now!” order, each accompanied by that brain-piercing alarm. Then came the West Hills blaze (labeled the Kenneth fire ) with an equally unclear evacuation warning/order for our elderly parents. Terror compounded.

They just got my uncle, immigration. The two had been talking at a Home Depot parking lot, less than a mile down the road from their home in Bakersfield when Border Patrol agents showed up and began asking questions. Information about constitutional rights for immigrants was provided at the Robert F. Kennedy High School Auditorium in Delano. (Tomas Ovalle/For The Times) Casarez dashed to the scene, where she said she saw a dozen agents. “It was ugly,” she said. They had already taken her husband away. The Border Patrol operation near Bakersfield lasted for several days and netted 78 arrests this week, raising alarm bells across the Central Valley, where a largely immigrant workforce helps harvest a quarter of the food grown in the U.S. Immigrant advocates say it was the largest enforcement operation in the Central Valley in years and fear that it could be a prelude of what’s to come under President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised mass deportations — a move that many fear will wreak havoc on the region’s agricultural and processing industries. Border Patrol confirmed that agents conducted a targeted enforcement operation in Kern County, saying it was aimed at dismantling transnational criminal organizations. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Agent Gregory K. Bovino said in statements on social media that dozens of agents had detained two child rapists and “other criminals,” as well as retrieved 36 pounds of narcotics, as part of Operation Return to Sender. Advertisement Bovino, who leads the agency’s El Centro sector that spans 71 miles of the Imperial Valley along Mexico border, said agents arrested others encountered during the course of the operation who were in the U.S. unlawfully. In the small farming towns outside Bakersfield, at gas stations and in the miles and miles of fields, everyone seemed to know about the arrests that had quickly spread across social media, sowing fear among migrant families, many of whom had children or spouses that were born here. And in the panic, even routine law enforcement presence at strip malls and freeway off-ramps was, at times, conflated online with immigration roundups. It’s unclear how long the enforcement actions could last; Bovino said agents are planning additional operations in Fresno and Sacramento. Advertisement “With our border under control in El Centro, we go where the threat is,” Bovino wrote in response to someone on Instagram who said they were puzzled as to why Border Patrol was conducting operations so far north of the border. The enforcement has perplexed local immigrant advocates, who questioned why the Biden administration was using its final weeks to target Central Valley migrant workers for deportation.

Go after the cartels — do your raids on those people.” Growers reported that workers had stayed home out of fear of being arrested, he said. The consequences of the operation, he fears, could ricochet across the economy that powers farms, dairies and food processing plants. Grape vines and trees will lose their crop if they aren’t pruned in time. Cows could die if workers don’t show up to milk them. “It does have effects on the food chain, without any question,” Cunha said. “But it has the greatest effect on those families because they can’t feed their children if they can’t work.” Casarez said she knew many people afraid to leave their house. A friend’s daughter hurt her arm at school. The woman was so scared to take her to the hospital that Casarez offered to accompany her. Just a day before her husband was detained, she had met with a lawyer so that they could fix his legal status. He had been in the country for more than a decade working in construction.

Print NOAA pegged 2024’s global average surface temperature at 1.46 degrees C above its preindustrial baseline, and NASA’s measurements put the increase at 1.47 degrees C. Research has shown that global warming is contributing significantly to larger and more intense wildfires in the western U.S. in recent years, and to longer fire seasons . Amid a week of horrifying wildfires in Los Angeles, government agencies in the U.S. and around the world confirmed Friday that 2024 was the planet’s hottest year since recordkeeping began in 1880. It’s the 11th consecutive year in which a new heat record has been set, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. “Between record-breaking temperatures and wildfires currently threatening our centers and workforce in California, it has never been more important to understand our changing planet,” Nelson said. Firefighters on Friday were battling to protect NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge from the Eaton fire, which has burned 13,690 acres and roughly 5,000 buildings thus far. Advertisement Research has shown that global warming is contributing significantly to larger and more intense wildfires in the western U.S. in recent years, and to longer fire seasons . The devastating fires in Southern California erupted after an abrupt shift from wet weather to extremely dry weather, a bout of climate “whiplash” that scientists say increased wildfire risks. Research has shown that these rapid wet-to-dry and dry-to-wet swings, which can worsen wildfires, flooding and other hazards, are growing more frequent and intense because of rising global temperatures. Climate & Environment Intensifying climate ‘whiplash’ set the stage for devastating California fires Research shows rapid shifts between wet and dry extremes are increasing. Scientists say this ‘hydroclimate whiplash’ contributed to California’s devastating fires. Jan. 9, 2025 Extreme weather events in 2024 included Hurricane Helene in the southeastern U.S., devastating floods in Valencia, Spain, and a deadly heat wave in Mexico so intense that monkeys dropped dead from the trees , noted Russell Vose, chief of the monitoring and assessment branch of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. “We aren’t saying any of these things were caused by changes in Earth’s climate,” Vose said. But since warmer air holds more moisture, the higher temperatures “could have exacerbated some events this year.” Last year’s data also notes a step toward a major climate threshold. Keeping the average global surface temperature from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels has long been seen as necessary to avoid many of the most harrowing climate impacts. NOAA pegged 2024’s global average surface temperature at 1.46 degrees C above its preindustrial baseline, and NASA’s measurements put the increase at 1.47 degrees C. In 2023 , NASA said the temperature was 1.36 degrees C higher than the baseline. Considering the margin of error in their measurements, “that puts the NOAA and NASA models comfortably within the possibility that the real number is 1.5 degrees,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Calculations from other organizations passed the 1.5-degree mark more clearly. Berkeley Earth and the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service both said the planet warmed to slightly more than 1.6 degrees C above pre-industrial times in 2024. The United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization said the increase was 1.55 degrees C and the U.K. Met Office, the country’s weather service, measured an increase of 1.53 degrees C . Although 2024 probably marks the first calendar year in which the average temperature exceeded the 1.5-degree threshold, it doesn’t mean Earth has passed the crucial target set in the Paris Agreement, Vose said. That describes “a sustained, multi-decade increase of 1.5 degrees,” something that’s not expected to occur until the 2030s or 2040s, the scientists noted. “For a long time, the global mean temperature changes were a bit of an esoteric thing — nobody lives in the global mean,” Schmidt said. “But the signal is now so large that you’re not only seeing it at the global scale … you’re seeing it at the local level.” Advertisement “This is now quite personal,” he said.

Savage and Andrea Chang Jan. 10, 2025 Updated 1:42 PM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court justices sounded highly skeptical Friday of TikTok’s free-speech defense, signaling they are not likely to strike down the law that could shut down the popular video site the day before President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office. The justices, both conservative and liberal, said Congress was concerned with the Chinese ownership of TikTok and the threat to national security. They also said the law in question was not an effort to restrict the freedom of speech. “Congress doesn’t care about what’s on TikTok,” said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. “Congress is not fine with a foreign adversary gathering all this data on 170 million Americans. ... Are we supposed to ignore the fact that its parent company is subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?” Advertisement He said he knew of no court precedent that would call for striking down such a law on 1st Amendment grounds. In their comments and questions, all the justices appeared to agree. “This law is targeted at a foreign corporation that doesn’t have 1st Amendment rights,” said Justice Elena Kagan. “There is a long tradition of preventing foreign ownership or control of media in the United States,” added Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Advertisement Lawyers for TikTok and many of its creators described the law as an unprecedented attack on the 1st Amendment. “Shuttering the platform will silence the speech of 170 million monthly American users,” they said. But Congress and the Biden administration said the Chinese-owned platform gives the government in Beijing access to “vast swaths of data about tens of millions of Americans,” which it “could use for espionage or blackmail.” Advertisement The justices agreed to decide TikTok’s 1st Amendment appeal on a fast-track schedule, and they are likely to issue a ruling within a few days. None of them sounded ready to declare the law unconstitutional. In recent years, the justices have often struck down federal regulations, usually on the grounds that Congress had not authorized such a far-reaching rule. But they are wary of striking down an act of Congress, particularly one based on a claim of national security. The shutdown law is due to take effect on Jan. 19. “We go dark. The platform shuts down,” TikTok attorney Noel Francisco told the court, if it did not act. Even if the justices were not ready to strike down the law as unconstitutional, he said they should issue an order that temporarily delays the law from taking effect. “A short reprieve would make all the sense in the world,” he said, because it would give Trump time to try to work out a deal that could keep TikTok in operation. In 2020, Trump, in his first term, issued an executive order requiring TikTok to separate itself from Chinese ownership, but it was blocked by courts. Advertisement President Biden and Congress took up the issue after receiving classified briefings about the potential threat from ByteDance, the Chinese-controlled company that operates TikTok. The administration tried and failed to work out a deal that would separate TikTok from Chinese control. The shutdown law had the support of large bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate, and Biden signed it in April. By its terms the law was due to take effect in 270 days, on Jan. 19. If the law goes into effect, it would be illegal for service providers such as Google or Apple to “distribute or maintain ... a foreign advisory controlled application” in the United States. Violations could result in huge civil fines. TikTok’s last and best hope may now rest with Trump. He changed his view last year about TikTok, which he said helped him reach young voters. Two weeks ago, he filed a brief urging the court to stand aside and allow him to make a deal with TikTok’s owners. Advertisement None of the justices asked about Trump’s intervention. The law allows for a one-time extension of up to 90 days if the new president determined there has been “significant progress” toward arranging a “qualified divestiture.” It is not clear whether Trump could invoke that provision to delay the law from taking effect. On Wednesday, an investor group spearheaded by former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt submitted an offer to ByteDance for TikTok’s U.S. business. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and a representative for the group, known as the People’s Bid for TikTok, declined to discuss the state of negotiations with the Chinese company on Friday. “Our assumption is the Supreme Court will uphold the law, and at that point the only way to preserve TikTok under law will be a divestiture,” said Tomicah Tillemann, presiden...",

Print SEOUL — They gathered in subzero temperatures, waving banners that read, “Stop the steal.” Some voiced  faint hope that President-elect Donald Trump would support their cause; others accused China’s Communist Party of infiltrating South Korea’s news media. All of it was in the service of one aim: to save South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. A month after his short-lived declaration of martial law led to the suspension of his presidential powers, Yoon, who is facing an impeachment trial and criminal insurrection investigation, has evaded arrest by holing up in his presidential residence in central Seoul. The gated compound, fortified now with barbed wire and buses parked to form a barricade, has become a rallying point for his last-remaining supporters: ultraconservative demonstrators  and YouTubers who believe, as Yoon  has claimed, that the country has  been overrun by North Korea sympathizers conspiring to destroy South Korea’s freedoms. Advertisement Among those who gathered here Wednesday was Lee Kwang-hoon, a 63-year-old apartment security guard who had taken off from work to join the several hundred Yoon supporters occupying the main road facing  the president’s residence. “The leftists are trying to set up President Yoon on insurrection charges,” he said. “We are here to save the country.” Primarily made up of older South Koreans in their 60s and 70s who are driven by the fervent anti-communist ethos of an earlier era, the group has aligned itself with Christian extremists, the American far right and YouTube channels awash in conspiracy theories. Advertisement Though long dismissed by the broader public as fanatics, Lee and his peers have found a newfound source of legitimacy: Yoon, who in recent weeks has openly amplified their ideas, including a widely debunked election conspiracy theory that was at the center of his botched martial law declaration. In a recent public address, Yoon acknowledged that he had instructed his defense minister to inspect the electronic systems at the National Election Commission, suggesting that the results of last year’s general elections — which delivered a massive legislative majority to the country’s liberal party — were the result of subterfuge. “How could the South Korean people trust the results of the election?” Yoon asked. Amid his mounting woes, the president has made his affinities to the far right even clearer. Advertisement On Jan. 1, two days before South Korean investigators made their first, unsuccessful attempt to detain him, he sent his supporters a signed letter that reiterated the familiar clarion call against “anti-state” forces and vowed to “fight until the end.” “I am watching your efforts through live YouTube broadcasts,” the letter said. With investigators preparing to make a second attempt in the coming days, Lee said he would throw himself between them and the president. “Even if they send in the police special forces unit, I’m going to block them with my body,” he said. “I would rather sacrifice my own life rather than live in a country controlled by communists.” Even before the current crisis, Yoon’s embrace of right-wing YouTubers stirred concerns. More than two dozen YouTube personalities were invited to Yoon’s inauguration by first lady Kim Keon-hee. Some were later appointed to government positions. In a memoir published last year, Kim Jin-pyo, the former speaker of the National Assembly, recalled meeting Yoon shortly after the 2022 Itaewon Halloween disaster, in which 159 people were crushed to death after being trapped in a narrow alley. When Kim urged the resignation of Interior Minister Lee Sang-min, Yoon responded that he had “strong suspicions” of the “possibility that the incident was induced and contrived by certain forces,” Kim wrote. Advertisement “I couldn’t believe that the sort of conspiracy theory talk that appears on far-right YouTube broadcasts was coming out of the president’s mouth,” the former speaker said. In recent weeks, rather than distancing themselves from Yoon, many in his party have followed suit. On Sunday, several lawmakers from Yoon’s conservative People Power Party attended a rally held by Jeon Kwang-hoon, an ultraconservative pastor who has stirred controversy for demonizing Muslims and advocating the institutionalization of gay people. The following day, 44 of them visited the rally in front of the presidential residence in a show of support. “I express my unlimited respect for these efforts to protect the president and the country,” said lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun. Some within the conservative camp have expressed alarm at the party’s embrace of a g...",

Print Six months after being cleared of criminal charges in the “Rust” shooting death , actor Alec Baldwin has filed a suit alleging malicious prosecution and defamation by New Mexico prosecutors and law enforcement. The 73-page civil complaint, filed Thursday in Santa Fe, N.M., names special prosecutor Kari T. Morrissey, 1st Judicial Dist. Atty. Mary Carmack-Altwies, Santa Fe County sheriff’s deputies and the Santa Fe County Commission. It contends that county officials went out of their way to defame Baldwin and that their pursuit of criminal charges deprived the actor-producer of his civil rights. The defendants were “blinded by their desire to convict Alec Baldwin for all the wrong reasons, and at any cost,” the lawsuit alleges. “Defendants sought at every turn to scapegoat Baldwin for the acts and omissions of others, regardless of the evidence or the law.” Advertisement Baldwin is seeking an undetermined amount of damages, including punitive damages, according to the suit. “As a direct and proximate result of the defendants’ unreasonable and unlawful actions, Baldwin has suffered and continues to suffer substantial past and future damages ... including ... legal expenses, loss of income, severe emotional distress, mental anguish, and embarrassment,” the lawsuit said. Hollywood Inc. Behind the spectacular collapse of the Alec Baldwin ‘Rust’ shooting prosecution The judge in the Baldwin involuntary manslaughter case dismissed the criminal charge after discovering the extent of an alleged effort to conceal potential evidence. July 13, 2024 The involuntary manslaughter case against  Baldwin was dismissed by a judge in July on what was supposed to be the third day of the actor’s trial. Instead, defense attorneys raised new questions over how New Mexico law enforcement officers and prosecutors handled evidence and grilled those seeking to prosecute Baldwin for the October 2021 death of Halyna Hutchins. Advertisement The decision ended a nearly three-year ordeal for the “30 Rock” and “Hunt for Red October” star after the on-set tragedy, when Baldwin accidentally shot Hutchins, the cinematographer on the low-budget western, during a preliminary run-through of a scene. Baldwin’s attorneys accused the state of misconduct, pointing to a batch of unexamined bullets that a potential witness turned over to sheriff’s investigators last March. New Mexico 1st Judicial District Court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer appeared furious over the handling of the evidence, which was not given to the defense, and dismissed the single charge against Baldwin. “Criminal prosecutions are supposed to be about the search for truth and justice, not to pursue personal or political gain or harass the innocent,” Baldwin attorneys Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro said in a statement. “Kari Morrissey and the other defendants violated that basic principle, over and over, and trampled on Alec Baldwin’s rights.” Advertisement Hollywood Inc. ‘Rust’ criminal case against Alec Baldwin officially ends as prosecutor withdraws appeal Prosecutors have abandoned efforts to appeal a New Mexico judge’s decision to toss the involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin, ending the botched case. Dec. 24, 2024 The lawsuit said despite Sommer’s dismissal of the case and her harsh criticism of the conduct of the local prosecutor and sheriff’s deputies, “this action is necessary to vindicate Baldwin’s rights and deter Defendants from attempt to do this to anyone else.” “In October 2023 the prosecution team became aware that Mr. Baldwin intended to file a retaliatory civil lawsuit,” Morrissey said in a statement. “We look forward to our day in court.” The original armorer in the film, Hannah Gutierrez, was convicted by a jury in March for involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins’ death.

Print WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday turned down President-elect Donald Trump’s plea to block a New York judge from sentencing him Friday on his felony conviction in a hush-money case. The vote was 5-4, with conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh saying they would have granted Trump’s request. The decision means Trump will be the first president to have a felony on his record when he  takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. Advertisement The majority in an unsigned opinion said Trump is still free to appeal his conviction later and said the sentencing hearing will not pose much of a burden, since he need not attend. Trump’s lawyers filed an emergency appeal on Wednesday that rested on a thin claim of immunity. Last year, the justices ruled that a president or ex-president was immune from criminal charges for his “official acts” while in office. Advertisement This week, Trump’s lawyers argued the justices should extend the immunity rule to shield the president-elect from being held accountable now for a private criminal scheme that began before his election as president. A New York jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records, a crime under New York law. He wrote checks to Michael Cohen, his former personal lawyer, to repay him for a $130,000 payment to an adult  film star to buy her silence prior to the 2016 election. The payments were listed as legal expenses. Jurors convicted him on 34 counts. Trump’s trial lawyers urged Judge Juan Merchan to delay his sentencing until after the November election. Advertisement Once Trump won the election, they argued the incoming president had an immunity from all the pending criminal cases, including his felony conviction. New York prosecutors had urged the court on Thursday to deny Trump’s “extraordinary immunity claim.” “While he was a private citizen, defendant [Trump] was charged, tried, and convicted for conduct that he concedes is wholly unofficial,” they said. In his appeal, he “makes the unprecedented claim that the temporary presidential immunity he will possess in the future fully immunizes him now,” before he is sworn in as president again, they said. On Tuesday, the day before his attorneys filed their emergency appeal in the high court, Trump arranged to speak with Alito about one of his former clerks. Alito confirmed the call to ABC News. “William Levi, one of my former law clerks, asked me to take a call from President-elect Trump regarding [Levi’s] qualifications to serve in a government position,” Alito said. “I agreed to discuss this matter with President-elect Trump, and he called me yesterday afternoon.” He said they did not discuss the “emergency application” regarding Trump’s New York sentencing, which had not been filed yet at the court. Advertisement “I was not even aware at the time of our conversation that such an application would be filed,” Alito said. “We also did not discuss any other matter that is pending or might in the future come before the Supreme Court or any past Supreme Court decisions involving the president-elect.” Alito cast a vote in favor of Trump.

Print WASHINGTON — Jimmy Carter ended his one-term presidency in defeat. For years he was derided as a weak leader. But over time a fundamental shift took place in how Carter was regarded , fueled by his decades of post-presidential good works and the enduring power of his White House achievements. Perhaps more than any single post-World War II president, Carter changed the way many saw the U.S. by attempting to inject American values of altruism, democracy and human rights into foreign policy. Advertisement Sometimes he succeeded, oftentimes not. But his effort left an indelible mark on nearly two generations of diplomats, public officials and global activists . Carter is to be remembered Thursday at a state funeral inside the cavernous Washington National Cathedral. President Biden will deliver the eulogy and all four living former presidents are expected to attend, including one inspired by him — President Obama — and one who routinely attacks him — President-elect Donald Trump. No major foreign leader is expected — at age 100, Carter outlived all those he interacted with. Keith Mines, a 32-year veteran of the departments of State and Defense, working from Mexico to the Middle East, recalled being stationed at Ft. Benning, Ga., with a military officer from Burkina Faso. During downtime, Mines suggested they check out Georgia’s beaches, mountains or the hopping city of Atlanta. Advertisement “I want to go to one place,” Mines recalled the African officer saying. “I want to go to Plains, Ga. I want to see the ... place that produced this remarkable man, Jimmy Carter.” Carter’s legacy is mixed. His administration succeeded in building key security platforms that endure to this day, while also promoting a broader global and domestic social agenda. As president, he officially made human rights the cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, with particular impact in Latin America. And he set a precedent for former presidents by continuing his public service, and charitable and human rights work, after leaving office. Advertisement Carter attempted to change the way the world viewed America at a particularly fraught time. The 1950s and ‘60s were characterized by U.S.-sponsored coups that overthrew governments that rulers in Washington didn’t like; then came the torturous Vietnam War and the scandalous tenure of Richard Nixon. Carter rose from nowhere, and became a president who spoke more about peacemaking than foreign conquest, about humanity over self-interest. He was willing to wield hard power when necessary but also saw the value of soft power, what he would call after his presidency the combination of “enticement, persuasion and influence,” which he often thought was even more effective in winning hearts and changing minds. “I’ve seen the foundational nature of Carter’s contributions to U.S. foreign policy ... in advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East, China, Russia ... but it does not end there,” Thomas Donilon, a former national security advisor under Obama and senior State Department official under President Clinton, said in an essay for Foreign Affairs. His stewardship led to t he first peace treaty between Israel and a warring neighbor, Egypt , which stands today as the most important such accord. Although tensions on the Middle East have ebbed and flowed, the successful Camp David negotiation won acclaim among Israelis and Arabs alike, who praised it as an evenhanded approach from the U.S. Advertisement Carter was a peacemaker but not a pacifist, and saw the need for military strength. In 1980, in response to the Iranian revolution and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, he declared the Carter Doctrine, which committed the U.S. to protecting oil production in the Persian Gulf and laid the basis for security infrastructure in that part of the world for Democratic and Republican administrations that followed for decades. In the waning weeks of his presidency, Carter approved the creation of the Joint Special Operations Task Force, a group of elite military from all branches that would train and plan top-secret reconnaissance missions and other clandestine deadly attacks. Carter saw its need after the failed attempt to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran. It remained in place, expanded through the years and eventually became involved in numerous controversial operations from Afghanistan to Iraq. Carter seemed most proud of his work on human rights and democracy building. His decision in 1977 to return the Panama Canal — long regarded regionally as a symbol of U.S. imperialism — to the government of Panama was widely praised in Latin America. It was a move initiated by Nixon at the urging of the U.S. military, w...",

Print For my entire career, it’s seemed, the Republican Party has run against Jimmy Carter. From my novice reporter days in Texas beginning midway through his single term, through my years in Washington covering presidencies and presidential campaigns into a new century, Republicans made Carter’s name synonymous with failure and hung it like an albatross around the necks of each Democratic nominee or president, right up through Joe Biden . “Another Jimmy Carter,” Republicans would snarl about almost any Democrat. Or worse than Carter: Sen. Tom Cotton,  Republican of Arkansas, tweeted in 2022 that “Jimmy Carter has a defamation case against anyone comparing him to Joe Biden.” Opinion Columnist Jackie Calmes Jackie Calmes brings a critical eye to the national political scene. She has decades of experience covering the White House and Congress. Read more from Jackie Calmes In death, however, Carter is being lionized by Republican leaders as well as Democrats upon his return to Washington to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda before his state funeral Thursday. “Whether he was in the White House or in his post-presidency years, Jimmy Carter was willing to roll up his own sleeves to get the work done,” eulogized House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who was just  4 when Carter won in 1976. Advertisement Don’t speak ill of the dead, goes the time-honored phrase. Yet Carter didn’t have to die before some historians and biographers, if not Republicans, began assessing his presidency more favorably. The centenarian lived long enough to read, see and even contribute to a justifiably kinder account of his time in office. Politics Jimmy Carter’s funeral begins by tracing 100 years from rural Georgia to the world stage Jimmy Carter’s public goodbye started in Plains, Ga., where the 39th U.S. president’s life began more than 100 years ago. Jan. 4, 2025 Such revisionist history is not uncommon for U.S. presidents. Polls showed that Harry Truman was popular with fewer than 30% of Americans at the end of his tenure, and George H. W. Bush’s rating sank even lower before voters ejected him for Bill Clinton. But both Truman and Bush lately have been more popular among history’s stewards, deservedly so. In the 2024 rankings of presidents by more than 150 historians, Truman was  sixth of the 45 presidents and Bush 19th, well ahead of his two-term son George W. Bush, No. 32. George W. used to tell us reporters on his campaign plane that history would look kindly on his father, even if voters hadn’t. On that, at least, I agreed with him. But I also figured (correctly) that time wouldn’t much improve his own standing. (Dead last in the ratings: the president just elected to the office again, Donald Trump.) Advertisement And Carter? He was No. 22 in 2024, up four spots from the previous listings in 2015 and 2018, putting him squarely in the middle of the presidential pack. Also, Carter ranked as “the most underrated president.” H.W. Bush was third in that category and Biden  sixth. Opinion Opinion: Jimmy Carter had a second term. It just wasn’t in the White House If Carter had won another term as president, those four years would have been far less fruitful than the faith-filled four-decade ‘second term’ that he and Rosalynn devised. Dec. 29, 2024 Biden, who will eulogize Carter at Washington National Cathedral on Thursday just 11 days before he exits the presidential stage, can take some solace in the record of revisionism. Perhaps. In 2024, he was ranked 14th among presidents, a respectable place and one reflecting the legislative achievements of his first two years and his restoration of normalcy after Trump’s norm-breaking. “One of the best one-term Presidents in American history,” presidential scholar Mark K. Updegrove recently wrote . But Biden’s standing could well suffer given his struggles in his last two years, especially his stubborn insistence on running for reelection — despite his prior talk of being “a bridge” to younger Democrats — until it was obvious he wasn’t up to another four years and his party pushed him out of the race. Advertisement For Carter, the decades-long narrative shorthand — failed one-term president, but model ex-president given his global humanitarian and diplomatic feats — has been altered (no pun intended, biographer Jonathan Alter ). He now gets justified credit for the consequential successes of his four years in the White House, achieved as he was otherwise buffeted by crises mostly inherited or inflicted, including high inflation, a global energy crisis and Soviet militancy.

Print In the spring of 1977, President Jimmy Carter, the former peanut farmer who had just taken office, was offered a big gift — if you can call it that — from the misty Northern California coast. A 9-ton redwood peanut. The roughly hewn goober had been strapped to the back of a logging truck, hauled across the country and parked near the White House. It was offered to Carter amid a protest by loggers angry and anxious about his administration’s plans to expand Redwood National Park along California’s northern coast and eliminate their jobs. Alas, the Carter White House rejected the peanut. It was trucked back to the Humboldt County hamlet of Orick, where, for nearly half a century, it stood unmarked in a gas station parking lot, its story fading into obscurity as the town struggled and shrank. Advertisement But in Humboldt County, the saga of the poor old peanut — which was obliterated in 2023 when a car slammed into it — has drawn renewed attention since Carter died last month at age 100.

(Katie Buesch) Two days after Carter’s death, the front page of the Times-Standard newspaper, just below his obituary, carried the headline : “Former president outlived the Orick ‘peanut.’” Advertisement At the Shoreline Fuel Mart, the longtime home of the languishing legume, an employee answered a phone call from a Times reporter this week with a sigh, saying: “Everybody keeps calling us about this.” Carter, whose extended public farewell concludes Thursday with a funeral at the Washington National Cathedral, was posthumously praised by the National Park Service for his “pivotal role in the story of Redwood National Park,” which he nearly doubled in size in 1978 despite heavy opposition from the timber industry. “This critical expansion included watersheds surrounding old-growth forests, ensuring they would be safeguarded for future generations to cherish,” Redwood National and State Parks officials said . “President Carter’s vision extended beyond the redwoods. His efforts remind us that leadership involves not only addressing the challenges of our time but also nurturing the earth for future generations.” Advertisement Obituaries Jimmy Carter, nation’s 39th president who became influential human rights advocate, dies Former President Carter returned again and again to charity work despite brain and liver cancer, finally entering hospice care at his Georgia home in February. Dec. 29, 2024 The creation — and Carter’s expansion — of Redwood National Park has long been a touchy subject along California’s rural, economically depressed North Coast, where the once-thriving logging industry cratered over the last half-century. Virtually all coast redwoods, the world’s tallest trees, grow in a narrow, fog-laden strip stretching from Big Sur to southern Oregon. By the time President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the legislation establishing Redwood National Park just outside Orick in 1968, more than 90% of the original redwoods had been chopped down . In the decade after the park’s creation, logging continued just outside its boundaries. Water and sediment from clear-cut land flowed into the park, damaging the protected space. In 1977, the Carter administration proposed adding 48,000 acres to the park, with the new protected land — much of it already logged — to be purchased by the government. Lumber production and employment had already been declining, in part because most old-growth trees had been cut and because newly mechanized mills required fewer workers. But in Humboldt County, loggers railed against the proposed park expansion, which would lead to the elimination of at least 1,000 jobs. They carved the protest peanut and strapped it to a logging truck alongside a sign reading: “It may be peanuts to you but it’s jobs to us.” Advertisement Redwood National Park was expanded by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 despite opposition from the logging industry.

But then, as night fell Tuesday on the nation’s capital, came the quieter tributes: ordinary people — first in the hundreds, swelling into the thousands — gathering in bitter cold outside the U.S. Capitol to pay their final respects to Jimmy Carter, the 39th American president, who died at 100 on Dec. 29. There were elders leaning on canes in the slushy snow, children so bundled up their arms nearly stuck out straight from their sides, teenagers bouncing on their heels as much from sheer energy as an attempt to keep warm.

(Shawn Thew / Associated Press) Advertisement Lottie Sneed, 73, was among the first in line, queuing up outside black wire-mesh barriers before the public viewing hours began at 7 p.m. When civil rights heroine Rosa Parks lay in honor in the Capitol Rotunda in 2005, the Maryland woman waited all night to file past her casket. She was glad not to have to do that this time, she said, but the underlying sentiment was much the same: a show of respect. “You leave a footprint for your life’s work,” she said. “You can’t always thank people at the time for their sacrifices, but you can do something to show that you saw, you noticed.” It was midnight when 17-year-old high-school student Josephine Flannery-Goodman neared the front of the line, mercifully an indoor affair at this stage, in the sprawling, statuary-filled Emancipation Hall below the Rotunda. She and her architect father, David Goodman, came to the public viewing almost on impulse, bundling into their coats in mid-evening and driving across the river from Arlington, Va. Josephine was excited to experience a bit of history, she said. For her father, 57, the occasion carried a hint of premonition as a new president is soon to take office, remembering his boyhood days as a time when Carter’s modesty-inflected presidency gave way to a more bombastic national mood under his successor, Ronald Reagan. Advertisement “After that,” Goodman said, “I always felt we were a very different country.” The Joint Chiefs of Staff pay their respects around the flag-draped casket of former President Carter.

Before entering the soaring chamber, people were asked to silence devices and refrain from photography. Chatter halted of its own accord. Onlookers involuntarily clasped their hands. Inside, an ethereal hush replaced the pinging and buzzing of text messages and news alerts. The only sound was the steady shushing of shoes and snow boots across the marble floor. The military members of the honor guard stood mannequin-still. Children raised their eyes skyward.

Advertisement Nearly everyone paused in their steps, some lingering for long moments. Some moved their lips in seeming prayer. Almost everyone looked pained and pensive. “With the wait beforehand, and then inside, there was a lot of time to think about why we’re here,” said Elizabeth Wason, 40, of Washington, leaning quietly against a pillar after she emerged. “It’s a really frenetic world. This gave time to just stand and think.” Ushers in red jackets thanked everyone for coming. They sounded as if they meant it. Outside, the darkness deepened. Temperatures — already a chilly 25 degrees as the evening viewing began — ticked down a degree, then two. An occasional scything wind flapped the flags flying at half-staff. People stamped their feet, cradled hands in their armpits, swaddled their faces. Here and there, a brilliant burst of color against the darkened sky: a fuchsia headscarf, a rainbow-striped puffer coat. Long conversations drew in side-by-side strangers. People chatted about books and movies, snowfall tallies and recipes. But they also talked about the jarring transition between political eras, and the consolations of a long and honorable second act like the one Carter had.

Print MEXICO CITY — At her daily news conference, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday displayed a colonial-era map of North America — with much of what later became the United States still shown as part of Mexico. “ América Mexicana ,” the president said, suggesting that the entire region revert to the 17th century classification, which translates to “Mexican America,”  shown in the map. “That sounds beautiful, no?” It was a  sly jab at President-elect Donald Trump — who a day earlier suggested that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed the Gulf of America. Advertisement “What a beautiful name,” Trump said. “And it’s appropriate.” Trump’s proposed geographic switcheroo was greeted with widespread derision in Mexico and throughout Latin America. “Obviously, the Gulf of Mexico is recognized by the United Nations,” Sheinbaum said, rejecting the notion that the signature body of water — which has borne Mexico’s name since colonial times — be rechristened. But Sheinbaum, a  scientist not known for her sense of humor, wasn’t done. She also adapted a playful tone to take issue with another Trump assertion. Advertisement He claimed that Mexico “is essentially run by the cartels. … Can’t let that happen. Mexico is really in trouble. A lot of trouble. Very dangerous place.” “With all due respect,” Sheinbaum said, the president-elect had been misinformed. Trump, Sheinbaum suggested, was apparently under the impression that the country was still being run by ex-President Felipe Calderón and his former security chief, Genaro Garcia Luna, the latter now serving a 38-year U.S. prison term for collaborating with the Sinaloa cartel. “But, no,” Sheinbaum said. “The people govern in Mexico.” Special correspondent Cecilia Sánchez Vidal contributed to this report .

Print SAN FRANCISCO  — Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, a prominent progressive Democrat who represented the East Bay in Congress for more than two decades, said Wednesday she will run for Oakland mayor in an April special election prompted by the recall of the city’s former leader. “I’ve never shied away from a challenge,” Lee said in a news release announcing her candidacy. “I’m always ready to fight for Oakland. Together, we can and will restore Oakland as a beacon for innovators, artists, builders, and entrepreneurs — creating opportunities that lift all families and neighborhoods.” Lee’s storied Bay Area political career took an uncertain turn after she ran unsuccessfully in 2024 for the U.S. Senate, finishing fourth in the March primary against fellow Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, who won in the November election. Advertisement Lee, 78, is running in an April 15 special election to fill the remainder of former Mayor Sheng Thao’s term, which ends in January 2027. Thao, a progressive politician elected in 2022, was recalled in November amid voter frustration with rampant crime, homelessness and a perception that the government had lost control of city streets. Alameda County Dist. Atty. Pamela Price, a vocal advocate for criminal justice reform, also was recalled in November. “[Lee] is perfect for right now. She has the progressive bonafides, but she is also willing to make compromises and she is pragmatic,” said Keally McBride, a University of San Francisco politics professor and an Oakland resident. “That is what Oakland is desperately needing right now.” Lee’s dominant name recognition and her long tenure representing the East Bay complicates the campaign for a list of local leaders who have already announced plans to run. Several candidates have indicated they would drop out if Lee joined the race. Advertisement “In terms of gaining respect and gaining alliances across the city, it would be hard to get a candidate better than her,” McBride said. “No one is going to be able to compete against her.” Nonetheless, Loren Taylor, a former Oakland City Council member considered a top contender for the post, said he is preparing to file candidate paperwork next week. Taylor, an engineer who represented East Oakland for four years on the council, narrowly lost to Thao in the 2022 mayoral race after garnering the most first-place votes in the city’s ranked-choice voting system, which allows voters to select multiple candidates by order of preference. “I am a kid from this town and have benefited so much from what Oakland could offer. I see the amazing potential of our beautiful, incredible city. But we’re not realizing it,” he said this week. Advertisement Taylor, 47, is more than 30 years Lee’s junior. He said that he respects Lee’s service in Congress, but that Oakland needs a mayor with a “fresh-perspective approach to leadership and government.” “One that is informed by working on the ground, in community and within City Hall,” Taylor said, “as opposed to someone who has been focused on Washington, D.C., Republican, Democrat politics at the national level.” “This is a different position, one that she hasn’t had. Executive administration is much different from legislating,” he said. Lee’s announcement generated excitement among several local community groups whose members have been lobbying her to jump in the race. They are hopeful that Lee, known in Washington for her anti-war positions and as a champion of civil rights, can usher in an era of stability in a city contending with several crises, including a gnawing budget deficit and surging crime rates. A coalition of local business, labor and education organizations implored Lee to run in a December letter calling for a new leader “who can restore integrity to the office of the mayor, unite us in a time of division, and help us address critical issues around the budget, public safety, housing, and inequity in our town.” Born in El Paso, Lee eventually moved to the Bay Area and attended Mills College in Oakland as a single mother. She obtained her master’s degree in social work from UC Berkeley in 1975, and founded an organization that offered mental health services to East Bay residents. Advertisement She served as chief of staff to the late congressman and former Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums, and won his congressional seat after he retired in 1998. Lee also served in the state Legislature in the 1990s. Even with her broad level of community support, Lee would inherit as mayor a list of weighty problems in Oakland that co...",
