At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected Russian demands to drastically reduce Ukraine's military, insisting on strong security guarantees and proposing the deployment of 200,000 European peacekeepers to enforce any agreement. Deputy Chairman of Russia's Security Council Dmitry Medvedev emphasised multipolarity following a discussion between Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, asserting the alignment of Moscow and Beijing on major global issues. n18oc_world n18oc_crux",

    "summary": "On 21 January 2025, a coalition of 22 Democratic-leaning states, led by California and New York, filed lawsuits against US President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The order, signed on 20 January, reinterprets the 14th Amendment to deny citizenship to individuals born in the US if their mother was unlawfully present or on a temporary visa and their father was not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident. Critics, including legal experts and civil rights groups, argue the order is unconstitutional as the amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born on US soil. California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the action \"un-American\" and vowed to challenge it in court. Separately, Trump revoked protections for \"sensitive areas\" like schools and hospitals during immigration enforcement operations, raising fears of mass deportations. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called for calm while preparing to handle the impact of Trump\u2019s policies. n18oc_world n18oc_crux",

Washington: President Donald Trump has instructed the US military to release a hold imposed by former President Joe Biden on the supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, a White House source told Reuters on Saturday. The move was widely expected. Biden put a hold on the delivery of those bombs due to concern over the impact they could have on the civilian population, particularly in Gaza's Rafah, during Israel's war in the Palestinian enclave. \"A lot of things that were ordered and paid for by Israel, but have not been sent by Biden, are now on their way!\" Trump said on the Truth Social media platform without providing further details. Trump and Biden have been strong supporters of US ally Israel, even as Washington has come under criticism from human rights advocates over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from Israel's military assault against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Protesters have unsuccessfully demanded an arms embargo. A ceasefire went into effect a week ago and has led to the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Before his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump had warned there would be \"hell to pay\" if hostages held by Hamas in Gaza were not released. Hamas took around 250 hostages during an Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli tallies. It sparked the latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed more than 47,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies. It also displaced nearly Gaza's entire population and caused a hunger crisis. Washington says it is helping Israel defend against Iran-backed militant groups like Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.

(AP Photo) President Donald Trump on Friday used his executive authority to restore U.S. participation in two international anti-abortion pacts, including one that cuts off U.S. family planning funds for foreign organizations if they provide or promote abortions. Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, which opponents call the \"global gag rule\" because they say it silences abortion advocates. Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it has been rescinded by each Democratic president since then and reinstated when a Republican returns to the White House. related stories Abortion is a divisive issue in U.S. politics and was a major issue in the 2024 campaign won by Trump. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to eliminate a nationwide right to abortion, leaving abortion laws to each of the 50 states. Trump said in his memorandum on Friday he was directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to implement the Mexico City Policy \"to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\" Democrats and abortion rights advocates contend the rule disrupts other forms of healthcare access and blocks nongovernmental organizations abroad from receiving U.S. funds, even if they use their own money on abortion care. Janeen Madan Keller, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said research showed that the \"gag order\" has led to an increase in unwanted pregnancies and abortions, counter to its intended impact. \"Broadly speaking these decisions are going to really set the United States back in advancing gender equality,\" Madan Keller said, in part by limiting the ability of women and girls to complete school and enter the workforce. Rubio also announced on Friday the United States was rejoining the Geneva Consensus Declaration, which critics say aims to limit abortion access for millions of women and girls around the world. The declaration was co-sponsored by the United States, Brazil, Uganda, Egypt, Hungary and Indonesia in 2020, when Trump was in office during his first term. It now has more than 35 signatories. The previous Trump administration said the declaration sought better healthcare for women and the preservation of human life, while also strengthening family as the foundational unit of society and protecting each nation\u2019s sovereignty. The State Department said on Friday that one of the four objectives of the pact was to \"protect life at all stages.\" top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Trump also issued an executive order related to the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion coverage in the United States, and rescinded two of predecessor Joe Biden\u2019s executive orders intending to preserve reproductive health services after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion. \"While this EO (executive order) has no immediate impact, it is an indication of the Trump administration doubling down on denying abortion access to people with low incomes,\" the women\u2019s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood said in a statement.

(AP file photo) Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince said Thursday the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Donald Trump earlier put a price tag on returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip. Trump\u2019s 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration\u2019s close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well. related stories The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Trump. \u201cThe crown prince affirmed the kingdom\u2019s intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\" the report said. The readout did not elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which once was the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well. Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment. There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Trump\u2019s call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first reported abroad. The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday. On Monday after his inauguration, Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, like he did in 2017. \u201cThe first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but \u2026 I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\" Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \u201cIf Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 \u2014 we\u2019ll up it for all the inflation \u2014 I think I\u2019d probably go.\" The 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom. Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own.

His pardons were criticised widely, including by the police unions. \u201cMost of the people were absolutely innocent, okay? Nobody\u2019s ever been treated so badly.

Isn\u2019t that a bigger threat?\" he asked. He noted that young people like TikTok, stating that his youth numbers were high, and \u201cmaybe that\u2019s because I went on TikTok\". Notably, Congress had banned the Chinese app in the US last year unless TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, sells it to the US. The ban was all set to come into effect starting Sunday (January 19). On its eve, TikTok suspended its services in the US briefly, only to be back online after Trump assured to sign an executive order directing the authorities to extend the period. Trump has directed the Justice Department not to enforce the ban for 75 days as his new administration chalks out a plan about the way ahead.

(IMAGE: REUTERS/NASA) Greenland\u2019s prime minister said Tuesday the Danish autonomous territory wanted to stake out its own future and did not want to become American, following US President Donald Trump\u2019s renewed remarks about taking control of the island. Trump, who took office on Monday, set off alarm bells in early January by refusing to rule out military intervention to bring the Panama Canal and Greenland under US control. related stories While Trump didn\u2019t mention Greenland in his inauguration speech on Monday, he was asked about it by reporters in the Oval Office afterwards. \u201cGreenland is a wonderful place, we need it for international security,\" Trump responded. \u201cI\u2019m sure that Denmark will come along \u2014 it\u2019s costing them a lot of money to maintain it, to keep it,\" he added.

Noting that the country was facing a \u201cdifficult situation\", Egede reiterated that Nuuk was open to talks with Washington to safeguard US interests in the Arctic, at a time when rivalries with China and Russia in the region are growing. The United States has an active military base in the northwest of Greenland, which has a strategic location in the Arctic as ice melts due to climate change and opens up new shipping lanes. The world\u2019s largest island \u2014 whose capital Nuuk is closer to New York than Copenhagen \u2014 also holds massive untapped mineral and oil reserves, although oil and uranium exploration are banned. \u201cWe have cooperated with the US on security issues for more than 80 years,\" Egede recalled.

Greenland is scheduled to call elections before April 6, where the question of independence is expected to top the agenda. Economically, Greenland depends on subsidies from Copenhagen equivalent to a fifth of its GDP, and on its fishing sector. Despite its autonomy, Copenhagen is in charge of judicial affairs, monetary policy, foreign affairs, defence and security policy in Greenland. On Monday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a post to Instagram that Europe would need to \u201cnavigate a new reality\" with Trump as president.

The EAM represented India as the Special Envoy to the PM and participated in the first Quad meeting held after Donald Trump took oath as the country\u2019s 47th president. related stories Jaishankar made the statement in the wake of his\u00a0bilateral meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. In a press briefing, Jaishankar said, \u201cIn terms of the irregular migration, we had a discussion on a range of issues and one of the issues which came up was mobility of people. We have a principled position on mobility that applies to all countries \u2013 as a government, we are very much supportive of legal mobility. We do believe in a global workspace. We want Indian talent and skills to have the maximum opportunity at a global level.\" \u201cAt the same time, we are very firmly opposed to illegal mobility and migration because when something illegal happens, many other illegal activities get joined into it. This is not reputationally good. We have always taken the view that if there are any of our citizens who are not there illegally, if we are sure that they are our citizens we have always been open to their legitimate return to India. It is not a position unique to the US. I also told him (Rubio) that while we understand all of this, it is in our mutual interest to facilitate legal mobility,\" he added. He cautioned the public about the number of 18,000 Indians reportedly living illegally in the US. \u201cAt our end, we have to verify if they are really Indians because naturally there are sensitivities involved there,\" he further said. Is India Taking Back Illegal Immigrants From US? Trump returned to the White House after a campaign centred around reducing illegal immigration and began his second term by ending birthright citizenship and declaring an emergency on the border. A report has surfaced that India has expressed willingness to collaborate with the Trump administration to take back 18,000 Indians living illegally in the US, although the real number could be much higher. Sources told Bloomberg that the Indian government was collaborating with the US authorities to identify undocumented Indian immigrants for deportation after the Trump administration began work on illegal immigration by mobilising troops along the US-Mexico border. According to the Pew Research Center, there are an estimated 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, making them the third largest group after those from Mexico and El Salvador. The move to identify and deport Indian immigrants was described as an attempt to placate Trump just as he takes office and avoid a trade war, the report said. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Trump had previously made threats of steep trade tariffs for India as part of his America-first policy and New Delhi is keen to avoid any trade conflicts as India-US ties have seen an upswing in the last few years. The Ministry of External Affairs earlier confirmed that both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration. The Indian government is also looking to protect the status of the H-1B visa for skilled migrants to the US, as 75% of the H-1B visas are given to Indian employees. Furthermore, a large-scale deportation of Indian migrants can lead to social and economic disruptions in India. tags : EAM S Jaishankar illegal immigration india us ties Trump administration Location : Washington D.C., United States of America (USA) First Published: January 22, 2025, 23:47 IST News india 'Open To Legitimate Return Of Indian Citizens Who Went To US Illegally': Jaishankar In US Read More",

In unusually critical remarks of Putin on Monday, Trump said the Russian president was \u201cdestroying Russia by not making a deal.\" The newly sworn in US president had previously promised a quick resolution to the conflict soon after taking office. \u201cLet\u2019s get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with!

A \"fiery\" phone call between President Donald Trump and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has reignited the debate over Greenland's future, with the US leader's intentions remaining unclear. Trump's unwavering stance on taking over Greenland, despite officials' repeated assertions that it's not for sale, has left many in Denmark and Greenland reeling. At the heart of Trump's interest in Greenland lies its strategic importance for national security. The island is rich in minerals crucial for technology and defense, including rare earth elements used in mobile phones, electric vehicles, and weapons. With China dominating the global rare earth market, Greenland's reserves have become increasingly vital to the US. Trump has been wanting to take over the island nation of 56,000 people since his first term. Greenland's location, straddling the shortest route between Europe and North America, makes it a critical spot for the US military and its ballistic missile early-warning system. As China and Russia expand their influence in the Arctic, the US seeks to maintain its dominance in the region. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, told Fox that Trump has made it clear \"the safety and security of Greenland is important to the United States as China and Russia make significant investments throughout the Arctic region. The President is committed to not only protecting U.S. interests in the Arctic but also working with Greenland to ensure mutual prosperity for both nations\". \"He was very firm,\" a source told the Financial Times, describing Trump's tone during the phone call. \"It was a cold shower. Before, it was hard to take it seriously. But I do think it is serious, and potentially very dangerous.\" The phone call was \"fiery\" with one official calling it \"horrendous\", per the Financial Times. The call \"utterly freaked out\" the Danes, one Danish official said. \"The intent was very clear,\" another official told the outlet. \"They want it. The Danes are now in crisis mode.\" Trump's aggressive pursuit of Greenland has been met with resistance from Denmark and Greenland. Frederiksen has emphasised that Greenland is not for sale, and its Prime Minister, Mute Edege, has reiterated that the island's people do not want to be part of the US. However, repeatedly, the US says that Greenland is important for its national security. Despite Frederiksen's offer to increase the cooperation between Greenland and US on military bases and resources, Trump was aggressive and confrontational. Moreover he has not ruled out the possible use of military force in Greenland. \"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social last month. Residents of Greenland have also expressed their distrust of Trump and his intentions. \"I don't trust the guy,\" Bilo Chemnitz, a resident of Nuuk, told The Washington Post. \"I want Greenland to stay like it is.\" \"I don't like the way he talks about Greenland,\" resident Ida Abelsen similarly told the Post. The diplomatic relations between the US and Denmark have been put to the test, as Trump's pursuit of Greenland continues to garner attention and criticism.

(IMAGE: REUTERS) The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary on Saturday, putting the South Dakota governor in charge of a sprawling agency that is essential to national security and President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to clamp down on illegal immigration. Republicans kept the Senate working Saturday to install the latest member of Trump\u2019s national security team. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was confirmed in a dramatic tie-breaking vote Friday night, joining Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. related stories The Senate will next vote Monday evening on Scott Bessent\u2019s confirmation as treasury secretary. Noem, a Trump ally who is in her second term as governor, received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier in the week. Republicans, who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her, have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement. \u201cFixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans\u2019 top priorities,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Friday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security. I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.\" Democrats are split on how to handle border enforcement and immigration under Trump, with some warming to his hard-line stand. Still, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he would vote against Noem. He pointed to \u201cbipartisan solutions to fix the mess at our border,\" adding that Noem \u201cseems headed in the wrong direction.\" The homeland security secretary oversees US Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies, the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation, protecting dignitaries, responding to natural disasters and more. Trump is planning major changes to how the department functions, including involving the military in immigration enforcement and reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those plans could immediately put Noem in the spotlight after the new president visited recent disaster sites in North Carolina and California on Friday. During her Senate hearing, Noem was repeatedly asked by Democratic senators whether she would administer disaster aid to states even if Trump asked her not to. Noem avoided saying she would defy the president, but she told lawmakers, \u201cI will deliver the programs according to the law and that it will be done with no political bias.\" Six people cycled through as homeland security secretary during Trump\u2019s first four years in office. Noem, who held her state\u2019s lone US House seat for eight years before becoming governor in 2019, has risen in the GOP by tacking closely with Trump. At one point, she was even under consideration to be his running mate. Her political stock took a momentary dip, however, when she released a book last year containing an account of her killing her hunting dog, as well as a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. If confirmed, she would be tasked with delivering on Trump\u2019s favorite issue, border security. The president\u2019s goals of deporting millions of people who entered the country illegally could put Noem, with her experience governing a rural state and growing up on a farm, in a difficult position. In South Dakota, many migrants, some in the country without permanent legal status, power the labor-heavy jobs that produce food and housing. She has so far pledged to faithfully execute the president\u2019s orders and copied his talk of an \u201cinvasion\" at the US border with Mexico. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Noem joined other Republican governors who sent National Guard troops to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star, which sought to discourage migrants. Her decision was especially criticized because she accepted a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire to cover some of the deployment cost. Noem said she opted to send National Guard troops \u201cbecause of this invasion,\" adding that \u201cit is a war zone down there.\" (This story has not been edited by News18 staff and is published from a syndicated news agency feed - Associated Press ) tags : donald trump Location : Washington D.C., United States of America (USA) First Published: January 25, 2025, 23:29 IST News world Senate Confirms Kristi Noem As US Home...",

Beamed on giant screens in the Swiss Alpine village, Trump received a loud round of applause from political and business A-listers who had eagerly awaited his appearance all week. related stories Speaking from the White House, the recently inaugurated president touted his plans to cut taxes, deregulate industries and crack down on illegal immigration. But he also had a tough message. \u201cCome make your product in America and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on earth,\" Trump said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff.\" In his wide-ranging speech, Trump made a link between the war in Ukraine and oil prices. Trump said he would ask Saudi Arabia and the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to bring down crude prices. \u201cIf the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,\" he said. He also had a message for central banks, saying he would \u201cdemand that interest rates drop immediately\" \u2014 in a signal that he might pressure the independent US Federal Reserve on the matter. The US leader then fielded questions from four top banking and energy executives. \u201cWell, Mr. president, I\u2019m sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today,\" quipped Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone investment firm, who had the first question. Trump answered the group one by one with a mix of praise, promises and reprimand. \u201cIf we make a deal, we make a deal. You\u2019ll get it,\" Trump said after the head of French energy giant TotalEnergies Patrick Pouyanne asked if he would agree to guarantee supplies of liquefied natural gas to Europe. He showered the head of Spanish banking group Banco Santander, Ana Botin, with praise. \u201cI know very much about your bank, and you\u2019ve done a fantastic job. Congratulations,\" he said. Trump had harsher words for Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan, accusing the firm and others of refusing to do business with conservatives. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a fantastic job,\" Trump said, before adding: \u201cI hope you\u2019re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you\u2019re doing is wrong.\" MILEI PRAISE Trump is always a top draw in Davos, making waves at two previous in-person appearances during his first term in 2018 and 2020. But showing up this year was tougher as the forum happened to start on the day of his inauguration in Washington on Monday. Scores stood in line to hear him speak. Some in the audience included IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva, European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde, Polish President Andrzej Duda and World Trade Organization head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. One of Trump\u2019s biggest cheerleaders on the world stage, Argentina\u2019s libertarian President Javier Milei, took the stage hours before Trump, delivering a fiery speech against \u201cthe mental virus of woke ideology\". Milei said Argentina was \u201cre-embracing the idea of freedom\" and \u201cthat is what I trust President Trump will do in this new America\". He also defended his \u201cdear friend\" Elon Musk. The US billionaire and Trump ally caused a stir this week by making hand gestures at an inauguration event for the US president that drew comparisons to the Nazi salute. Milei said Musk, the head of Tesla and SpaceX, has been \u201cunfairly vilified by wokeism in recent hours for an innocent gesture that only means\u2026 his gratitude to the people\". LET\u2019s NOT HYPERVENTILATE Trump had already given Davos a taste of what was to come since his inauguration on Monday, which coincided with the WEF\u2019s first day. He has threatened tariffs on China, the European Union, Mexico and Canada, pulled the United States from the Paris climate pact and renewed his claim to the Panama Canal, just to name a few.

Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr reset Follow us on Google News US President Donald Trump directed officials to declassify files on the assassination of president John F. Kennedy. (Courtesy: Reuters) United States President Donald Trump ordered the declassification on Thursday of the last secret files on the assassination of former president John F. Kennedy, a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death. Trump signed an executive order that will also release documents on the 1960s assassinations of JFK\u2019s younger brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. related stories \u201cThat\u2019s big one, huh? A lot of people have been waiting for this for years, for decades,\" Trump told reporters as he signed the order in the Oval Office of the White House. \u201cEverything will be revealed,\" he said. After signing the order, Trump passed the pen he used to an aide, saying \u201cGive that to RFK Jr.,\" JFK\u2019s nephew and the current president\u2019s nominee to become secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The order Trump signed requires the \u201cfull and complete release\" of the JFK files, without redactions that he accepted back in 2017 when releasing most of the documents. \u201cIt is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,\" the order said. Trump had previously promised to release the last of the files, most recently at his inauguration on Monday. \u2018Overwhelming Evidence\u2019 The US National Archives has released tens of thousands of records in recent years related to the November 22, 1963 assassination of Kennedy but held thousands back, citing national security concerns. It said at the time of the latest large-scale release, in December 2022, that 97% of the Kennedy records \u2013 which total five million pages \u2013 had now been made public. The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy\u2019s murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories. Trump\u2019s move is partly a gesture to one of the most prominent backers of those conspiracies \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself. RFK Jr. said in 2023 there was \u201coverwhelming evidence the CIA was involved\" in his uncle JFK\u2019s murder and \u201cvery convincing\" evidence the agency was also behind the 1968 assassination of his own father, Robert F. Kennedy. The former attorney general was killed while campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president. Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-born Jordanian, was convicted of his murder. Anti-vaccine activist RFK Jr. was rewarded with the health nod in Trump\u2019s cabinet for dropping his independent presidential bid and backing the Republican, but he faces a rocky nomination process. Conspiracy Theories Thousands of Kennedy assassination-related documents from the National Archives were released during Trump\u2019s first term in office, but he also held some back on national security grounds. Then-president Joe Biden said at the time of the December 2022 documents release that a \u201climited\" number of files would continue to be held back at the request of unspecified \u201cagencies.\" Previous requests to withhold documents have come from the CIA and FBI. Kennedy scholars have said the documents still held by the archives are unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th US president. Oswald, who had at one point defected to the Soviet Union, was shot to death two days after killing Kennedy by a nightclub owner, Jack Ruby, as he was being transferred from the city jail. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Hundreds of books and movies such as the 1991 Oliver Stone film \u201cJFK\" have fueled the conspiracy industry, pointing the finger at Cold War rivals Russia or Cuba, the Mafia and even Kennedy\u2019s vice president, Lyndon Johnson. Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in April 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray was convicted of the murder and died in prison in 1998 but King\u2019s children have expressed doubts in the past that Ray was the assassin.

Trump had signed the order on Monday, his first day back in office. related stories The judge, an appointee of Republican former President Ronald Reagan, dealt the first legal setback to the hardline policies on immigration that are a centerpiece of Trump\u2019s second term as president. \u201cObviously we\u2019ll appeal,\" Trump said of Coughenour\u2019s ruling. Trump\u2019s executive order had directed US agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the United States if neither their mother nor father is a US citizen or lawful permanent resident. \u201cI am having trouble understanding how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this order is constitutional,\" the judge told a US Justice Department lawyer defending Trump\u2019s order. \u201cIt just boggles my mind.\" The states argued that Trump\u2019s order violated the right enshrined in the citizenship clause of the US Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment which provides that anyone born in the United States is a citizen. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can\u2019t remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,\" Coughenour said of Trump\u2019s policy. Coughenour\u2019s order, announced following a short hearing in a packed courtroom with other judges watching, prevents Trump\u2019s policy from being enforced nationwide for 14 days while the judge considers whether to issue a long-lasting preliminary injunction. He will hear arguments over whether to do so on February 6. Under Trump\u2019s order, any children born in the United States after February 19 whose mother and father are not American citizens or lawful permanent residents would be subject to deportation and would be prevented from obtaining Social Security numbers, various government benefits and the ability as they get older to work lawfully. \u201cUnder this order, babies being born today don\u2019t count as US citizens,\" Washington state Assistant Attorney General Lane Polozola, referring to Trump\u2019s policy, told the judge during the hearing. Justice Department lawyer Brett Shumate argued that Trump\u2019s action was constitutional and called any judicial order blocking it \u201cwildly inappropriate.\" But before Shumate had even finished responding to Polozola\u2019s argument, Coughenour said he had signed the temporary restraining order. \u2018VIGOROUSLY DEFEND\u2019 The Justice Department plans to file papers next week to urge the judge not to issue a longer injunction, Shumate said. A Justice Department spokesperson said it plans to continue to \u201cvigorously defend\" Trump\u2019s order. \u201cWe look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the court and to the American people, who are desperate to see our nation\u2019s laws enforced,\" the spokesperson said. Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, a Democrat, said he sees no reason to expect that the Justice Department would succeed in overturning Coughenour\u2019s ruling on appeal, even if the matter goes to the US Supreme Court, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump. \u201cYou are an American citizen if you were born on American soil \u2013 period,\" Brown said. \u201cNothing that the president can do will change that.\" More than 150,000 newborn children would be denied citizenship annually if Trump\u2019s order is allowed to stand, according to the Democratic-led states. Since Trump signed the order, at least six lawsuits have been filed challenging it, most of them by civil rights groups and Democratic attorneys general from 22 states. Democratic state attorneys general have said that the understanding of the Constitution\u2019s citizenship clause was cemented 127 years ago when the US Supreme Court ruled that children born in the United States to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 following the US Civil War, overturned the Supreme Court\u2019s notorious 1857 Dred Scott decision that had declared that the Constitution\u2019s protections did not apply to enslaved Black people. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all In a brief filed late on Wednesday, the Justice Department called t...",

(IMAGE: AP PHOTO) President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The new entity, Stargate, will start building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum. related stories \u201cIt\u2019s big money and high quality people,\" said Trump, adding that it\u2019s \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\" under his new administration. Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has already started and the project goes back to 2024. \u201cThis will be the most important project of this era,\" said Altman, CEO of OpenAI. Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine. \u201cThis is the beginning of golden age,\" said Son, referencing Trump\u2019s statement that the US would be in a \u201cgolden age\" with him back in the White House. Son, a billionaire based in Japan, already committed in December to invest $100 billion in US projects over the next four years. He previously committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump\u2019s first term, which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company WeWork. While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented. The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers. OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration\u2019s Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects \u201ccan be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.\" Other partners in the project include Microsoft, investor MGX and the chipmakers Arm and NVIDIA, according to separate statements by Oracle and OpenAI. The push to build data centers predates Trump\u2019s presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally. Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChatGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks. The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI\u2019s expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses. Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology\u2019s possible risks to national security and economic well-being. CBS News first reported that Trump would be announcing the AI investment. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit status and has started his own AI company, xAI.
