According to sources, Mumbai Police had sent the fingerprints found at Mr Khan's home to the fingerprint bureau of the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID). A system-generated report has established that the prints do not match Shariful's. The CID, sources said, has informed the Mumbai Police that the test result is negative. Mumbai Police has sent more samples for further testing. The 54-year-old actor suffered six stab injuries in a shocking attack on January 15 after an intruder broke into his home. When Mr Khan confronted the intruder, the latter attacked him with a knife. One of the stab injuries Mr Khan suffered was on his spine. The intruder managed to escape and Mr Khan was rushed to Lilavati Hospital with serious injuries. Doctors have said one of the knife injuries was on the actor's spine and had caused his spinal fluid to leak. They also said the knife was just 2 mm away from his spinal cord. Mr Khan, they said, is recovering well. He was released from hospital on Tuesday and has been advised bed rest for a week. The accused, Shariful, is a Bangladeshi national who entered India illegally. He has told police that someone had promised to get fake citizenship documents made for him in exchange for money. This, he has said, was why he attempted the burglary at Mr Khan's home. Police are now looking for the person who promised to get Shariful's documents made. The sources have said Mumbai Police had contacted Western Railway to help identify the suspect captured on footage of CCTV cameras in the 12-storey building where the actor lives. The accused, it is learnt, had boarded a train from Bandra station and Railways had used its facial recognition system to shortlist some suspects whose appearance matched the intruder's. Sources said this was done because the footage of the intruder exiting the building was unclear. While Shariful was arrested based on CCTV footage, police are trying to gather more evidence to build a bulletproof case against him.

Washington: President Donald Trump has instructed the US military to release a hold imposed by former President Joe Biden on the supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, a White House source told Reuters on Saturday. The move was widely expected. Biden put a hold on the delivery of those bombs due to concern over the impact they could have on the civilian population, particularly in Gaza's Rafah, during Israel's war in the Palestinian enclave. \"A lot of things that were ordered and paid for by Israel, but have not been sent by Biden, are now on their way!\" Trump said on the Truth Social media platform without providing further details. Trump and Biden have been strong supporters of US ally Israel, even as Washington has come under criticism from human rights advocates over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from Israel's military assault against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Protesters have unsuccessfully demanded an arms embargo. A ceasefire went into effect a week ago and has led to the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Before his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump had warned there would be \"hell to pay\" if hostages held by Hamas in Gaza were not released. Hamas took around 250 hostages during an Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli tallies. It sparked the latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed more than 47,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies. It also displaced nearly Gaza's entire population and caused a hunger crisis. Washington says it is helping Israel defend against Iran-backed militant groups like Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.

New Delhi: Raman Rajamannan, the 'king' of Kerala's Mannan community, will attend the 76th Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi on January 26. King Rajamannan will be accompanied by his wife Binumol. OR Kelu, Minister for Welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes, handed over the Republic Day invitation to the tribal king. This will be the first time a tribal king will attend the Republic Day parade in Delhi. Rajamannan, the only tribal king in Kerala, and his wife flew to Delhi on Wednesday. They will visit various places after the parade and return on February 2. Travel expenses will be borne by the Scheduled Caste Development Department, Minister Kelu said in a social media post. He will wear headgear (thalappavu) and traditional clothes, marking the special occasion and will be assisted by two Ministers and soldiers during the functions. Rajamannan is the head of 300 families of Mannans, a tribal clan living in 48 settlements in the Idukki district. The King holds a special place in the rituals and festivities of the Mannan community. He took the reins of his little kingdom, back in 2012, after the death of Aryan Rajamannan. An economics graduate, Rajamannan lives an ordinary life as a farmer. He doesn't have a royal palace or a chariot. Instead, he resides in a simple house and manages a local temple along with his family. The king has no rights or duties in civil society, but oversees community matters with the help of four upa rajas (deputies), one ilayaraja (prince), and a 50-member council of ministers, known as kaanis, reported The Indian Express. Reportedly, the Mannan community follows a matrilineal system, meaning women hold the inheritance rights.

New Delhi: Huge tri-colour-themed banners have been put up along the Kartavya Path while the theme for this year's tableaux that would roll down the boulevard where the annual Republic Day celebrations take place is 'Swarnim Bharat: Virasat aur Vikas', focusing on 75 years of the enactment of the Constitution. However, the maiden celebrations marking the birth of the Republic of India were not held on Rajpath (now Kartavya Path), the historical avenue that has over time become synonymous with the ceremony. It was held in the 1930s-era Irwin Amphitheatre after the country got its first president. Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia, was the chief guest at India's first Republic Day celebrations in 1950. And 75 years later, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be the chief guest at this year's ceremonial parade which will also see the participation of a marching contingent and a band contingent from that country. Iconic public buildings, parks and railway stations dazzled with lights on the night of January 26, 1950, turning the capital city into a \"fairyland\". Fauji Akhbar (now Sainik Samachar), in its February 4 article 'Birth of a Republic', said, \"At the most solemn ceremony, held in the brilliantly lit and high domes of Durbar Hall at Government House, India was declared a Sovereign Democratic Republic exactly at 18 minutes past 10 on the morning of Thursday, January 26, 1950. Six minutes later, Dr Rajendra Prasad was sworn in as president.\" \"The birth of the Indian Republic and the installation of its first president were announced by a salute of 31 guns shortly after 10:30 am,\" it reported. In an impressive swearing-in ceremony, retiring Governor-General C Rajagopalachari read out the proclamation of the Republic of \"India, that is, Bharat\". \"And whereas it has been declared by the said Constitution that India, that is, Bharat, shall be a Union of States comprising within the Union the territories which were hitherto the Governor's provinces, the Indian states and the Chief Commissioners' provinces,\" the military journal had quoted the last Governor-General's speech. The president then took the oath and made a brief speech, first in Hindi and then in English. \"Today, for the first time in our long and chequered history we find the whole of this vast land from Kashmir in the north to Cape Comorin in the South, from Kathiawad and Kutch in the west to Coconada and Kamrup in the east, brought together under the jurisdiction of one Constitution and one Union, which takes over the responsibility for the welfare of more than 320 million men and women that inhabit it,\" President Prasad said in his historic speech. The country erupted in celebration soon after Prasad was sworn in as India's first President. The elegant exposed-brick structure of the Irwin Amphitheatre, topped with cupolas above its main facade, was later redeveloped into the National Stadium. Its front lawns served as the venue of a National School Band Competition held ahead of the 76th Republic Day celebrations on January 24-25. PTI visited this historic landmark ahead of this year's celebrations. According to a marble plaque installed on its wall, the Irwin amphitheatre was built in 1933 as a gift from the then Maharaja of Bhavnagar who donated Rs 5 lakh for its construction and was opened by the then viceroy Lord Willingdon. The amphitheatre was named after the former Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, who had inaugurated the new British capital New Delhi in February 1931 during his viceroyalty. Designed by Robert Torr Russell, also the architect of the iconic Connaught Place in central Delhi, the amphitheatre was renamed the National Stadium in 1951 just before the Asian Games was hosted. According to another plaque installed in another portion of the building, the foundation stone of the National Sports Stadium was laid by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Prime Minister of India on January 19, 1950, just a week before the first Republic Day celebrations were held at the venue. About the first Republic Day celebrations, the over 100-year-old Fauji Akhbar had said, \"The president drove out of the Government House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) in state exactly at 2:30 pm in a 35-year-old coach specially renovated for the occasion bearing the new emblem of Asoka's capital and drawn by six sturdy Australian horses, at a slow trot, escorted by the president's bodyguard.\" As the procession made its way through the Irwin Amphitheatre, chants of \"jai\" echoed through the streets with cheers of people perch...",

More so in India, where competition can be intense. But then, Indian sport is abound with stories where despite humble background, players rose to became stars with sheer discipline and hard work. Former India player Manoj Tiwary is one such name. He played 12 ODIs and three T20Is for India. But had he been a little more fortunate, he would have featured in more international matches. Tiwary played with the likes Sachin Tendulkar , MS Dhoni , Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma , Gautam Gambhir  during his time with the Indian cricket team. He scored 796 runs at an average 99.50 in the 2006-07 Ranji Trophy season. He led Bengal for a long time and was one of the best cricketers to emerge from the state. Tiwary, however, had to face a lot of struggle both on and off the field. He even thought of taking early retirement after he did not get enough opportunities for an extended period in the Indian team. \"Due to responsibility, I did not take early retirement,\" he said. He was also asked on his struggle in the teenage years when he had to work hard to pay off loans. \"Those were difficult times. One thing I always had in mind was that I had to pay off the loan. We have Mangla Haat In Kolkata, there I used to sell poori sabzi . My mom used to make the pooris. Sometimes people did not even pay for the food that they ate,\" Manoj Tiwary said on Lallantop . \"I worked in factories of nut and bolts. This was around when I was around 14 years old. I got Rs 1200 per match when I played in U-16 level. So I did the maths and made sure I did well in cricket so that the  money always comes. I ran away from the factory. It was too hectic. The factory owner used to make us work.\" When his debut came in 2008 it was not special. He slammed his maiden ODI century against West Indies in Chennai in 2011, but was benched for months after that game. MS Dhoni was the skipper of the side duting that time. Advertisement \"He was the captain. Team India runs according to the planning of the skipper. In state teams, things are different but in Team India its all about the captain. If you see, during Kapil Dev 's time it was he who ran the show, during Sunil Gavaskar 's tenure it was his call, same was during Mohammad Azharuddin 's tenure. After that Dada and so on. This will go on unless a strict administrator comes and makes a set rule,\" Manoj Tiwary said. Listen to the latest songs , only on JioSaavn.com \"You see Ajit Agarkar (current BCCI chief selector) and you feel he can take strong decisions. He can disagree with the coach. As far as me being dropped for 14 matches after scoring a century, if a player is dropped after scoring a century, obviously I want to know the answer. After century I was praised, but post that I did not have any inkling. At that time, youngsters used to feel afraid, including me. If you ask something, who knows what way it could have been taken. Career is on the line. \"The players who were in the team then were Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina , Rohit Sharma. After that the Tour which took place, they were not making runs. And here I was, even after making a century and winning Player of the Match, could not find a place in playing XI. I was dropped for 14 matches, which took place in a space of six months.

Press Trust of India Updated: January 26, 2025 08:29 am IST Read Time: 3 min facebook twitter WhatsApp reddit E-mail Shubman Gill has, of late, developed a tendency to lose focus after getting 25-30 runs. © X (Twitter) India batter Shubman Gill on Saturday conceded that he has, of late, developed a tendency to lose focus after getting 25-30 runs in red-ball cricket, evidence of which was seen in a couple of his dismissals during the five-match Test series in Australia. Gill identified this as an area of concern soon after making a fine second-innings hundred for Punjab on the third day of their Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka. His 102-run knock, though, went in vain as Karnataka hammered the visitors by an innings and 207 runs. \"Red-ball batting is a concern. Sometimes, I think with the red ball, in the matches that I play, I get very good 25-30 runs. \"I think in those moments, sometimes I put too much pressure on myself to be able to score big runs. I think that is not the way that I have grown up playing my game,\" Gill said. The elegant batter, who is a treat to watch when in full flow, added, \"There is a certain zone that I am in, certain intent that I am in and sometimes I think I lose that because I put too much pressure on myself that I have to get a big run now that I am set. \"I think in those crucial moments, I sometimes lose my focus and concentration. I think it keeps you in the game all the time. \"As a person, I like to be involved in the game and what is happening. I think it brings out the best in me as a player when I am constantly involved in the game.\" On the Indian team's last tour of Australia, Gill made just 93 runs in six innings at an average of 18.60. He missed the series opener in Perth due to injury and was dropped for the Boxing Day Test at MCG. This innings on Saturday will give him some confidence going forward. \"I think any innings that we play at any level, it's very important to be able to get runs, get back in form and have that feel. When you are playing well, when you are in that zone, it's important to stay in that zone as long as possible and that's what I was trying to do when I was batting there. Advertisement He described the knock as \"satisfying\", having got out off an inside edge in the first innings. \"I think this innings was very satisfying for me, the way I played. The first, I think, in 130 balls, I scored 40-odd runs, and they were bowling well and there was some help in the wicket as well. So, keeping that in mind, I think I was very satisfied with the way that I was playing. \"After the lunch, I just thought to play a little bit more of my shots. Also, the wickets were falling from one end. So, I wanted to make sure that I am getting some runs as well, playing some shots.\" He said no amount of practice can give a player what he derives from playing in a competitive match at this level. \"I think if there is a chance, we must keep in mind that there is enough of a gap between the match and the next series that you are going to play. So, if there is enough gap, if there is 15-20 days between that, then I think it is very helpful to play the match because the match feels different no matter how much you practice. Advertisement \"When you go out there playing at any level, there are certain aspects of your game that are challenged when you are playing a match. So, it is helpful.\" Gill likened this surface to the one that was used for the Test match against New Zealand three months ago. \"I think the first inning when we batted, the wicket was quite damp. I think it was like the match that we played against New Zealand here. The only difference that I would say, there was a little bit more grass on this wicket. \"And in the second innings, I think it got a little easier to play your shots. In the first inning, the ball was stopping and seemed a bit too much to play the shots. Listen to the latest songs , only on JioSaavn.com \"In the second inning, the ball was still, I felt seaming, but it was still easier to play your shots because the ball was coming at a good pace.\" Among the India stars returning to the domestic circuit, Gill was the lone centurion and played 171 balls for his knock.

Edited by: Anushree Jonko World News Jan 25, 2025 20:41 pm IST Published On Jan 25, 2025 20:39 pm IST Last Updated On Jan 25, 2025 20:41 pm IST Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email A \"fiery\" phone call between Trump and Mette Frederiksen has reignited the debate over Greenland's future The notion of the United States purchasing Greenland has been a topic of discussion for months, but recent developments suggest that President Trump's administration is more serious about the proposition than initially thought. A \"fiery\" phone call between President Donald Trump and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has reignited the debate over Greenland's future, with the US leader's intentions remaining unclear. Trump's unwavering stance on taking over Greenland, despite officials' repeated assertions that it's not for sale, has left many in Denmark and Greenland reeling. At the heart of Trump's interest in Greenland lies its strategic importance for national security. The island is rich in minerals crucial for technology and defense, including rare earth elements used in mobile phones, electric vehicles, and weapons. With China dominating the global rare earth market, Greenland's reserves have become increasingly vital to the US. Trump has been wanting to take over the island nation of 56,000 people since his first term. Greenland's location, straddling the shortest route between Europe and North America, makes it a critical spot for the US military and its ballistic missile early-warning system. As China and Russia expand their influence in the Arctic, the US seeks to maintain its dominance in the region. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, told Fox that Trump has made it clear \"the safety and security of Greenland is important to the United States as China and Russia make significant investments throughout the Arctic region. The President is committed to not only protecting U.S. interests in the Arctic but also working with Greenland to ensure mutual prosperity for both nations\". \"He was very firm,\" a source told the Financial Times, describing Trump's tone during the phone call. \"It was a cold shower. Before, it was hard to take it seriously. But I do think it is serious, and potentially very dangerous.\" The phone call was \"fiery\" with one official calling it \"horrendous\", per the Financial Times. The call \"utterly freaked out\" the Danes, one Danish official said. \"The intent was very clear,\" another official told the outlet. \"They want it. The Danes are now in crisis mode.\" Trump's aggressive pursuit of Greenland has been met with resistance from Denmark and Greenland. Frederiksen has emphasised that Greenland is not for sale, and its Prime Minister, Mute Edege, has reiterated that the island's people do not want to be part of the US. However, repeatedly, the US says that Greenland is important for its national security. Despite Frederiksen's offer to increase the cooperation between Greenland and US on military bases and resources, Trump was aggressive and confrontational. Moreover he has not ruled out the possible use of military force in Greenland. \"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social last month. Residents of Greenland have also expressed their distrust of Trump and his intentions. \"I don't trust the guy,\" Bilo Chemnitz, a resident of Nuuk, told The Washington Post. \"I want Greenland to stay like it is.\" \"I don't like the way he talks about Greenland,\" resident Ida Abelsen similarly told the Post. The diplomatic relations between the US and Denmark have been put to the test, as Trump's pursuit of Greenland continues to garner attention and criticism.

He was in Nevada at an event intended as a victory lap in a critical swing state that he won on his way to a second term.

He said Biden's office would tell the world leaders that \"he'd call you back in two months.” “So two months comes along, and there's no call,” he added, laughing off the “extremely busy” schedule of the former President. Donald Trump said the stories were not very exaggerated, only a little “for laughter”, the true timeline being 1 month. In contrast, Trump said, he answers the phone right away. “The problem I have is that when I speak to them I speak immediately. They say, could we speak to the President? Would that be possible?

Sky Force Box Office Collection Day 2 Akshay Kumar-Veer Pahariya's film saw a massive 75.51% uptick in earnings on its second day in theatres. According to Sacnilk data, the film earned ₹ 21.5 crore on Saturday. With this, the film has minted a total of ₹ 33.75 crore in two days. Sacnilk said earnings are expected to jump further on Sunday, Republic Day. The industry tracker has estimated that the film will earn around ₹ 60 crore net on its opening weekend.

Akshay Kumar’s movie’s advance booking for Day 1 Heavily discounted tickets The industry tracker said Sky Force might not have been able to collect this much money with regular ticket prices from the opening day. However, it highlighted that having heavily discounted ticket prices is not a good long-term plan, even if it has worked in favour of movies to bring the audience in large numbers and spread word of mouth. The movie's second-day collection indicates that it has managed to draw moviegoers' attention, but its real test will begin on Monday. A good hold during working days, possibly with positive word of mouth, will put the movie in the best position to score a success, Sacnilk said. Sky Force Box Office Collection Day 1 Veer Pahariya has been a lucky charm for Akshay Kumar , who is marking his best movie premiere in years with Sky Force. After years of box office flops for Akshay, this aerial action thriller opened to double-digit collections. His last hit movie was Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi in 2021.

The colourful wildlife-themed illustration, created by Pune-based artist Rohan Dahotre, features a number of animals representing various regions of India, woven into the letters of 'GOOGLE' to resemble a lively 'wildlife parade'. Among the highlights are a peacock in flight, a crocodile, a snow leopard dressed in traditional Ladakhi attire, a tiger sporting a dhoti-kurta while playing a musical instrument, and an antelope carrying a ceremonial staff. What this Google Doodle represents? Rohan Dahotre, a wildlife illustrator who created the illustration, said his \"initial thoughts centered around showcasing the unity of people from diverse cultures coming together to celebrate.\" \"My goal was to create a doodle that was not only colorful but also inclusive, representing a wide spectrum of Indians to ensure it resonated with everyone. As a wildlife illustrator, I also considered incorporating animals dressed in traditional human attire, an idea that was met with enthusiasm,\" he said. Rohan Dahotre, said he is a always inspired by India's rich and diverse culture. \"Often described as a land of 'unity in diversity,' India beautifully reflects this spirit through its people coming together from various cultural backgrounds,\" he said. \"My illustration also draws inspiration from the diverse wildlife of my nation. India boasts incredible biodiversity, from the cold, snowy regions of the Himalayas in the north to the lush rainforests of the Western Ghats in the south, where new species are still being discovered at this moment,\" Dahotre said. He added, \"The country's varied habitats include deserts, wetlands, grasslands, lakes, and seas, each home to unique flora and fauna. My aim was not only to highlight India's regions, cultures, and geographical richness.\" What message this Google Doodle convey? Dahotre said the first message is about maintaining unity in diversity. \"This is the essence of what Republic Day teaches us - how people from different cultures come together as one for the nation. I believe this principle should extend beyond India to the entire world. The 21st century should not stand for war but for acceptance and peace. Together, all nations can embrace their differences and unite for the betterment of humanity,\" he said.

(Image/Screenshot) In an exclusive interview with Network18 Group Editor-in-Chief Rahul Joshi at the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj on Saturday, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath offered a comprehensive view of the massive spiritual gathering, political landscape, and his vision for India. Sitting in front of the holy confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers, Yogi Adityanath delved into multiple critical aspects of governance, spirituality, and cultural significance. Asserting that the Maha Kumbh 2025 stands as a testament to India’s spiritual heritage, the UP chief minister highlighted the event’s unprecedented scale. He anticipated that 40-45 crore devotees would participate in the 45-day congregation, transforming the gathering into a powerful symbol of national unity and cultural pride. related stories Beyond the religious spectacle, Yogi Adityanath revealed his broader political philosophy, deeply rooted in what he described as Sanatan Dharma’s principles of inclusivity and integrity. He discussed crucial topics ranging from economic development and welfare schemes to challenges like illegal immigration and the implementation of a uniform civil code. In conversation with Network18, the CM also provided insights into his personal journey —from a mathematics student to a sanyasi and now a prominent political leader — reflecting his belief in service to the nation and commitment to cultural preservation. Edited excerpts: RAHUL JOSHI: Yogi ji, thank you very much for giving this exclusive interview to News18. We are in the Maha Kumbh area today. We are looking at the gathering. The event is grand, unparalleled and spectacular. I would like to know a little about it from you. What went into organising such a big event and what is your message to the world? YOGI ADITYANATH: Rahul ji, firstly, I heartily welcome News18 and your team to the Maha Kumbh area. Whatever you are seeing in Prayagraj and Maha Kumbh Nagar is the concrete form of the vision of the respected Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India’s heritage should get its due respect. It is an example of how it is the responsibility of the government to respect the faith. The divine and grand Kumbh is a testament to this belief. Today’s generation is getting to know about the heritage of thousands of years and the older generation is taking pride in passing on India’s cultural heritage to its next generation so that they can protect it and take it forward in the same grand way. The images from the Maha Kumbh that you witness are the divine and grand form of the Sanatan Dharma. This is what Sanatana is known for. It is India’s tradition to organise such grand Kumbhs to uphold our cultural and spiritual legacy. Such events were started with this aim. This is the holy land of Prayagraj. Crores of devotees take a dip in the Triveni of Maa Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in the presence of saints and get their share of punya (goodness). RAHUL JOSHI: I have been to the Kumbh earlier as well. In 2019, you organised a grand Ardh Kumbh, and I came there too. But the kind of crowd I am seeing this time is usually what we witness on the Mauni Amavasya Snaan. But now there is such a crowd every day. YOGI ADITYANATH: This gathering is a message of the unity of India. You are right. Usually, we would see huge crowds on Mauni Amavasya, but we are seeing similar numbers every day. In 2019, 4 crore devotees bathed in the Sangam on the day of Mauni Amavasya. This time, 4 crore devotees bathed in the Sangam on the day of Makar Sankranti itself. In the past 10 days, more than 10 crore devotees have taken a dip in the Sangam. Today, more than 2 crore devotees are in the Maha Kumbh area for the holy dip. This will go on till February 3. On Mauni Amavasya, we expect the crowds to multiply three to five times compared to 2019. RAHUL JOSHI: Three to five times! What is the total footfall you expect? YOGI ADITYANATH: In my estimate, the 45-day congregation at Maha Kumbh will see a footfall that will be equivalent to the third-largest population in the world…after India and China…in this temporary set-up. We expect 40-45 crore devotees will give the message of national unity through the holy dip at the Sangam. RAHUL JOSHI: Congratulations on this great gat...",

Former judge Muzaffar Iqbal Khan, who won the Assembly election from the Thanamandi constituency as an independent candidate after being denied a ticket by his party the National Conference (NC) following an agreement with its coalition partner Congress, urged for immediate restoration of statehood to end the ‘dual power’ system in the Union Territory. related stories Khan, along with NC leader and MLA Budhal Javaid Iqbal Choudhary and Congress MLA from Rajouri Iftkhar Ahmad, threatened to resign to protest “mishandling of the situation\" in the Badhaal village, where 17 persons belonging to three families died due to mysterious illness between December 7 and January 19. “The press conference was held to express our disappointment and displeasure about this dual system, which is working here in Jammu and Kashmir and has to be stopped somewhere.

In her address to the nation ahead of the 76th Republic Day, she emphasised the government’s ongoing efforts to “eliminate remnants of a colonial mindset that have lingered in the country for decades\" and cited the replacement of the British-era criminal laws with three new modern laws. related stories “We have been witnessing concerted efforts to change that mindset… Reforms of such magnitude require an audacity of vision,\" she said. Highlighting the significance of the proposed bill aimed at synchronising election schedules across the country, Murmu noted, “The ‘One Nation One Election’ plan can offer numerous benefits, including enhanced governance and reduced financial strain.\" In discussing legal reforms, she pointed out the need to replace the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Indian Evidence Act with new laws reflective of Indian traditions. She mentioned the introduction of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, which prioritise the delivery of justice over mere punishment and place a strong emphasis on addressing crimes against women and children. Reflecting on the significance of the Constitution, the President highlighted the progress achieved over the past 75 years. “At the time of Independence, many parts of the country faced extreme poverty and hunger. However, we maintained a belief in ourselves and created conditions for growth,\" she said. Noting the contributions of farmers and labourers, she said India’s economy now plays a pivotal role in global economic trends, asserting that this transformation is rooted in the framework established by the Constitution. The President also pointed to the persistently high economic growth rate in recent years, which has generated job opportunities, increased income for farmers and labourers, and lifted many out of poverty. She underscored the importance of inclusive growth and the government’s commitment to welfare, making basic necessities such as housing and access to clean drinking water entitlements for citizens. Efforts to support marginalised communities, particularly those belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC), were also highlighted. Murmu mentioned various initiatives, including pre-matric and post-matric scholarships, national fellowships, and dedicated schemes aimed at the socio-economic development of these communities, such as the Pradhan Mantri Anusuchit Jaati Abhyuday Yojana and the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan. The President’s address underscored the government’s commitment to fostering inclusive growth and redefining governance standards in the country, creating a vision for a more equitable and prosperous future for all citizens. She emphasised that this occasion is a collective celebration of joy and pride for all citizens and remarked that while 75 years may seem like a brief moment in the life of a nation, it has been a significant period for India, marked by the revival of its long-dormant spirit and its journey to reclaim its rightful status among the world’s civilisations. Reflecting on India’s historical journey, she urged citizens to remember the brave souls who sacrificed their lives for the nation’s freedom, highlighting the 150th birth anniversary of Bhagwan Birsa Munda, whose contributions to the freedom movement are now receiving due recognition. The President praised the early 20th-century freedom fighters for uniting the nation in a well-organised independence movement and credited iconic figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, and Babasaheb Ambedkar for helping India rediscover its democratic values. “Justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity are not just modern concepts; they have always been integral to our civilisational heritage,\" she asserted, noting that skeptics of the Constitution’s future were proven wrong.

If the country remains united, the country will remain safe, he added. reset Follow us on Google News CM Yogi Adityanath said if there is security of unity, prosperity will come automatically. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s “ batoge toh katoge \" (If you divide, you will be destroyed) slogan during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections last year had raised some eyebrows. Months later, in an exclusive interview to Network18 Group Editor-in-Chief Rahul Joshi at the Maha Kumbh Mela, the CM explained the meaning of the slogan and how he coined it. The slogan, a call apparently to Hindus to stay united, had sparked a controversy, with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav claiming that the BJP had distanced itself from the slogan. Ajit Pawar — an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Maharashtra — openly disagreed with the chief minister, and said that development cannot happen by creating such differences among each other. related stories Speaking to Network18 on the controversy, Yogi Adityanath recalled his trip to Agra where he unveiled the statue of Durgadas Rathore, the Rathore Rajput general of the kingdom of Marwar. “During Haryana elections, I got the opportunity to go to Mathura. I stayed there for a night, and next day went to Agra to unveil the statue of Durgadas Rathore. In the medieval period, Durgadas Rathore was a very valiant general of the Jodhpur king,\" CM Yogi said. The Story Behind CM Yogi’s ‘Batoge Toh Katoge’ Slogan “According to the tale, when Aurangzeb could not defeat Maharaja Jaswant Singh, the king of Jodhpur, he made a pact with him. Aurangzeb asked them to attack the Afghanis and assured support from behind. When Jaswant Singh ji went to attack the Afghans, Aurangzeb — instead of helping the king as promised — attacked the Raja by deceit. And Raja Jaswant Singh was martyred in that war,\" Yogi Adityanath narrated. “His son Ajit Singh was with him. The queen was also with him. When General Durgadas Rathore saw that after killing the Raja, Aurangzeb’s army was planning to kill the prince, he took Ajit and the queen, and kept them in an ashram. When Prince Ajit Singh grew up, Durgadas put in all the efforts to make Ajit the king of Jodhpur. Till the age of 91, Durgadas Rathore lived in Jodhpur. After that he took sanyaas and went to Ujjain, where he breathed his last,\" the chief minister said. Yogi Adityanath further said, “All those who associate with the story, and who belong to the ‘Rathore-Teli’ caste wanted to install a statue of Durgadas in Agra, but some communities were opposing it. We called both the communities and talked to them. In the end, a compromise was reached. Then when the statue was installed, I said: If you’ll be divided, you will be destroyed. If you remain united, you will be worthier.\" New Slogan: ‘Ek Rahoge Toh Safe Rahoge’ CM Yogi said, “I am thankful that the honourable Prime Minister took this message forward, and gave the slogan of ‘ Ek Rahoge, Safe Rahoge ‘ to connect the entire country. I believe that the message of Maha Kumbh is also that the country will remain united only through unity. If the country remains united, the country will remain safe.\" “Sanatan Dharma will remain safe. Every caste, every opinion, every sect, every creed will also remain safe. And if there is this security, prosperity will come automatically,\" Yogi Adityanath added. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Amit Shah Too Had Spoken On CM Yogi’s Slogan When News18 Hindi had asked Union Home Minister Amit Shah to respond to the controversy over “batoge toh katoge\", he said, “As far as division is concerned, it is the work of Congress.

Most terrorist attacks happened during their time.

(S Jaishankar/X) Whether you are unhappy with your job, or are working long hours, or you are newly married or have kids – stress is a normal part of your life. Managing stress has become the key priority of our lives, but we often go the wrong way about this. In this regard, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had unique advices for people on how to manage stress. The minister emphasised the need for developing confidence to manage stress, self-motivation and accept the mistakes of your lives and rectify them. “No one is perfect. People normally talk about your success, and you talk about your own success. It would be very interesting if we pause for a moment and thought where you did not do that,\" he said, adding that he always remembered the exams he did not clear. related stories The External Affairs Minister was speaking in Delhi at the book release of author Shiv Khera’s ‘ Live While You’re Alive’ , which deals with several aspects of stress management and work-life balance. In his keynote address, Jaishankar shared anecdotes from his personal life and his career as a diplomat and politician to advice people on how to manage stress. Jaishankar’s 3Cs Of Success “Most people obviously understand that I passed the UPSC, but I sat for the IIT entrance exam and I did not pass. Recently, I was attending an event and someone went through the great trouble of getting my school report. They got a copy of it, had a presentable version of it, and they were under the mistaken impression that it would be a good report,\" he said at the event. Jaishankar stressed that no one should feel dejected after a setback and constantly strive for self-improvement. “When I look at my own particular responsibilities now but even earlier as diplomat, I had to aspire to reach the 3Cs of success. Contact – the more people you know, the greater your reach. Chemistry – If you get along with people, they are more likely to do things for you. Credibility – if you are known to be good on words, people take you seriously,\" he said. The EAM also quipped that avoiding chronic stress and being a minister don’t go too well, drawing some laughs from the audience. “My most honest answer (to manage chronic stress), you normalise the abnormal. You build your life around it, you de-stress it by making it a part of your life. If your phone rings in at 2 in the night, you answer it and go back to sleep and get up at 6 or 7 and try to remember and hope what you said was right.\" ‘Invest In Relationships, Get A Good Night’s Sleep’ Jaishankar also shared his six takeaways from Shiv Khera’s new book: Plan for the unplanned Invest in relationships No appeasement No toxicity Respect time Get a good night’s sleep “I think these takeaways are really very sensible advice offered to people, who may be very stressed or may not be stressed. You won’t certainly be stressed if you follow these things,\" he said. Glad to join the book release of ‘Live While You’re Alive’ authored by @imshivkhera .My six takeaways from the book: 1️⃣ Plan for the Unplanned.2️⃣ Invest in Relationships.3️⃣ No Appeasement.4️⃣ No Toxicity.5️⃣ Respect Time.6️⃣ Get a Good Night’s Sleep.

Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) January 24, 2025 The minister also highlighted the importance of discipline in life, citing the example of young volunteers going to China’s Wuhan at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic to get back Indians. “Most people started work from home, but the Ministry of External Affairs moved to a three-shift routine. More people came to work everyday. Instead of work from home, for us it was go home occasionally… At that time, I saw what discipline does, what a sense of duty does.\" “If there is personal motivation, organisational motivation, if that is the culture, people will be willing to go the extra mile and more to get things done.\" ‘No Risks, No Rewards’ Jaishankar stressed that there were no rewards without risks, which meant that people had to take on some stress. He cited the examples of diplomats personally overseeing the evacuation of Indian nationals from war-torn areas of Ukraine and Sudan. “We could not have got the job done if we had not taken risks,\" he said. Another important aspect, Jaishankar said, was being there for others at the right time, cited the examples of India delivering crucial economic aid to Sri Lanka and Covid-19 vaccines to Caribbean countries. “The aver...",

(Courtesy: PTI) Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to table the Union Budget 2025-26 in her traditional ‘Bahi-Khata’ on February 1 and the agriculture sector expects the government to introduce reforms which can increase productivity, rural income and enhance exports. The sector has received consistent allocations in the budget and has seen a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4% from fiscal year 2019-20. related stories The outlay for the agriculture and farmers’ welfare department stands at Rs1.32 lakh crore in the current fiscal year which is slightly more than the revised budget of Rs1.27 lakh crore for fiscal year 2024. In the Union Budget 2024-25, the government allocated Rs 1.52 lakh crore to the Agriculture and Allied sectors. The government also introduced different schemes for boosting the Indian agricultural sector last year. So, the question is what game-changing reforms will the Union Budget introduce this year for the agriculture sector? Analysts Predict Budget Plan For Agricultural Sector As per the analysts, the Union Budget will most likely introduce fertiliser subsidies and welfare schemes for the agricultural sector and also introduce measures for improving the infrastructure. According to the forecast of the Bank of America Securities, there can be a marginal increase in subsidies. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has forecast that the expenditure of the government on rural, welfare, transfer schemes and subsidies will be around 3% of GDP. It added that some reallocation can be made in expenditure directed towards welfare spending and rural transfers. The analysts of Bank of America said that budget allocation on welfare schemes like PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana should see an increase and plans to upgrade roads in the rural areas should be introduced. The experts have also hinted at the introduction of measures for improving crop protection solutions and introducing agri-tech innovations. According to Reuters, two officials said that the government plans to increase expenditure on the agriculture sector by around 15%. They added that the additional cash will be directed towards, increasing storage and supply infrastructure, developing high-yielding seed varieties and improving the production of dairy products, vegetables, pulse crops and oilseeds. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The analysts are also expecting budget allocation for improving irrigation facilities, warehousing infrastructure and supply chain efficiency in the agriculture sector. tags : #UnionBudget Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman Location : New Delhi, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 15:36 IST News business Budget 2025: Game-Changing Schemes Or Consistent Allocation | What's In Bahi-Khata For Agri Sector?

The move has reportedly left the U.S. State Department \"shocked\" or surprised, as it directly affects ongoing U.S. support for Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict with Russia.The decision to halt military aid or projects could have significant implications for U.S.-Ukraine relations and may reflect broader political tensions in Washington over the level of support for Ukraine. This comes at a time when military and financial assistance from the U.S. to Ukraine has been a subject of debate within U.S. politics, with some figures calling for a reduction in aid or changes to U.S. policy toward Ukraine.The statement by Donald Trump could be highlighting his perspective on this situation, potentially in relation to his own position on U.S. involvement in the war or on foreign aid more broadly.00:00 INTRODUCTION03:22 USAID ‘FREEZES’ PROJECTS SUPPORTING UKRAINE n18oc_crux",

A US court dismissed a review petition against his conviction in the case, crushing Rana’s last legal chance to avoid being extradited to India. Who is Tahawwur Rana? related stories Tahawwur Hussain Rana, was tried in a US District Court on charges related to his support for a terrorist organisation that carried out the Mumbai attacks and another terror conspiracy in Denmark. The US Supreme Court on Saturday approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana to India. The writ petition which was filed in November last year was denied by the Supreme Court a day after Donald Trump assumed the role of US President.

The US didn’t accept his arguments and pleas. I am happy that the Trump government will send him immediately,\" Nikam told CNN-News18 . related stories India was seeking the extradition of Rana, a Canadian national of Pakistani origin, as he was wanted in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks case. The US court dismissed a review petition against his conviction in the case, crushing Rana’s last legal chance not to be extradited to India. Earlier, he lost a legal battle in several federal courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the North Circuit in San Francisco. On November 13, Rana filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the US Supreme Court, which was denied on January 21, the day after Donald Trump was sworn in as President. The Supreme Court issued a simple statement: “Petition DENIED.\" Rana, 64, is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Los Angeles. Previously, on December 16, the US government had argued that the petition should be rejected. US Solicitor General Elizabeth B Prelogar made this argument in a filing with the Supreme Court, stating that not all the conduct for which India sought Rana’s extradition was covered by the US prosecution. Specifically, she pointed to India’s forgery charges, which involved actions not addressed in the US case, such as Rana’s submission of false information to the Reserve Bank of India when applying to open a branch office of the Immigration Law Centre. Prelogar also noted that the verdict in the US case, which involved conspiracy charges, was difficult to interpret and did not necessarily mean that Rana had been convicted or acquitted of all the specific conduct India had charged. Rana is linked to Pakistani-American terrorist David Coleman Headley, a key figure in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which 166 people were killed, including six Americans, as 10 Pakistani terrorists carried out a siege on several key locations in Mumbai over 60 hours.

Jawans below 35 years can now be named for CoBRA. “As desired by the competent authority, the enhancement of the age limit for induction into CoBRA Units, as mentioned above, will be for one year only, as sufficient numbers of CT/GD below 30 years are not available for SCT-2025,\" the communication says.

Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder in which the peripheral nervous system is attacked by the immune system of the body, as per the World Health Organisation. The syndrome is seen in people who get infected with bacteria or viruses. The syndrome affects the nerves which control muscle movement and those that have touch, temperature and pain sensations which leads to loss of sensation in the legs and/or arms, muscle weakness and difficulties in breathing or swallowing. French neurologists Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barre first discovered this syndrome in 1916. The exact cause behind the disease is not clear, however, it often occurs after a viral or bacterial infection, vaccination, or major surgery. The immune system becomes hyperactive during such periods which leads to this rare condition. Pune’s emergency medical expert Dr Padmanabh Keskar said that cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome have been reported earlier in India. “We occasionally see cases of this disease in our hospitals. However, a sudden spike in cases is certainly a cause for concern,\" he said. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all tags : Guillain-Barre syndrome hospital outbreak Pune Location : Pune, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 08:46 IST News india Cases Of Guillain-Barre Syndrome Rises To 73 In Pune.

Representational pic/PTI The Bombay High Court has held that the use of loudspeakers is not an essential part of any religion while denying permission for the use of loudspeakers for Azan (Islamic call to prayer) exceeding permissible noise levels, and violating the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. A division bench comprising Justice AS Gadkari and Justice Shyam C Chandak clarified that denying permission for loudspeakers does not violate constitutional rights under Articles 19 or 25. “Noise is a major health hazard on various aspects. No one can claim that his rights are affected in any manner if he is denied a permission to use loudspeaker. It is in public interest that such permissions should not be granted. By denying such permissions, rights under Article 19 or 25 of the Constitution of India are not at all infringed,\" the court remarked. related stories The bench was hearing a plea filed by two housing societies in Mumbai’s Kurla area, alleging police inaction against noise pollution caused by loudspeakers installed in nearby mosques. The petitioners sought a direction to the police to register a First Information Report (FIR) against the offenders for using loudspeakers at unbearably high volume without permission. It was further argued that the use of loudspeakers during the early hours of the morning, around 5:00 am, falls within the “prohibited hours\" under prevailing laws. Moreover, during festival days, loudspeakers are operated until 1:30 am, exceeding the permissible time limit for their usage, even if such use is purportedly authorised by the concerned authorities. The court firmly stated that noise pollution is a major health hazard, and no religion mandates practices that disturb public peace. Citing the Supreme Court’s precedent in Church of God (Full Gospel) in India, the court reiterated that “undisputedly no religion prescribes that prayers should be performed by disturbing the peace of others nor does it preach that they should be through voice-amplifiers or beating of drums. That, in a civilised society in the name of religion, activities which disturb old or infirm persons, students or children having their sleep in the early hours or during day-time or other persons carrying on other activities cannot be permitted.\" The court clarified that the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, does not provide for registering an FIR, as Section 19 permits cognisance of offences only on complaints by specified authorities. While the petitioners sought a direction for crime registration, the absence of such provisions prevented this. However, considering the issue of noise pollution from loudspeakers used for Azan and other discourses, and non-compliance with directives in Mahesh Vijay Bedekar vs State, which held that “no religion has ever permitted violation of law for celebrating religious festivals\", and issued directions to the state to address the issue of noise pollution, the court decided to entertain the petition. Criticising the police for failing to enforce laws, the court reiterated their duty to act decisively against violations. It stated, “In a democratic State, there cannot be a situation that, a person/group of persons/ association of persons would say that, it will not follow or adhere to the law of the land and the law enforcers would be meek or silent spectators to it.\" Additionally, the court directed the authorities to: 1.    Strictly enforce the Noise Pollution Rules and seize equipment violating decibel limits. 2.    Use decibel-measuring applications for monitoring noise levels. 3.    Respond promptly to public complaints without disclosing the complainant’s identity. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all 4.    Impose substantial penalties for violations to deter future non-compliance. The judges also ordered the state government to consider directing all the concerned to have an “inbuilt mechanism\" to control the decibel levels in their loudspeakers, voice amplifiers, public address systems, or other sound-emitting gadgets used by any religious place, structure, or institution, irrespective of religion. tags : Bombay High Court loudspeaker religion Location : New Delhi, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 01:18 IST News india Use Of Loudspeakers Not Essential Part Of Any Religion: Bombay High Court Read More",

        "full_content": "Indians Work Similar Hours To Emerging Economies, More Than Developed Nations: EAC-PM Report Reported By : Aman Sharma News18.com Last Updated: January 25, 2025, 00:11 IST The finding comes at a time when there is growing debate in the country about the ideal number of working hours reset Follow us on Google News The results show that on an average, a person working in the government spends 45 minutes less on work each day than a corporate worker. (Representational image via AP) Indians work similar hours to other emerging economies and significantly more than developed countries, according to a latest note from the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM). The note, written by EAC-PM member Dr Shamika Ravi, further states that working more hours is closely linked to higher per capita GDP. related stories The finding comes at a time when there is growing debate in the country about the ideal number of working hours. “Urban Indians in regular jobs at private and public limited companies work most number of hours. Government employees work fewer hours than average Indians and significantly lesser than employees of Private and Public Limited companies,\" Dr Ravi added in her report. The recent statement of L&T chairman SN Subrahmanyam, that working hours can extend to 90 hours per week, and employees can work Sundays rather than staring at their wives at home, triggered a big debate. NRN Narayana Murthy had earlier highlighted the importance of working 70 hours a week, sharing his own experience at Infosys. Dr Ravi analysed the nationally representative Time Use Survey conducted by the Government of India in 2019. “I find that 1% more time spent on employment-related activities is positively associated with a higher (1.7%) per capita NSDP. This relationship is stronger and more robust for large states of India (3.7% increase in NSDP) than small states and UTs (1.8% increase in NSDP),\" Ravi’s note said. This implies that if people in a state spend 1% more time on economic activities, then the state’s NSDP will rise by 1.7%, the note says. The EAC-PM note says the overall results indicate that while India is comparable to other emerging economies of the world in terms of the number of daily working hours, it is also true that major economic gains can be made by increasing the time on employment related activities. Shorter Work Hours In NE States, Govt Sector “This is particularly relevant for states (the Northeastern states) and sectors (government sector) where people work significantly shorter hours per day compared to the rest of the country,\" the EAC-PM note says. The note looked at the data is to check how many people meet the benchmark of 700 minutes per day or 70 hours per week, across states of India. “The results are presented in Gujarat has the largest proportion of people (7.21%) who work for more than 70 hours per week, Bihar has the lowest proportion at 1.05%,\" the note says. The results show that on an average, a person working in the government spends 45 minutes less on work each day than an average Indian, and he works almost an hour less compared to a person working in a private or public limited company. Workers In Private & Public Sectors Spend More Time Working On the whole, people working in companies (whether public or private) are spending one more hour working each day, compared to government employees, the note says. A main finding is that on an average, Indians spend 422 minutes per day on paid economic activities or 42 hours per week (assuming 6 day per week), which is significantly lower than the 700 minutes per day or 70 hours per week benchmark expectation being set. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “However, comparing across countries, Indians report working hours which are comparable to other fast developing countries like Vietnam, China, Malaysia, and Philippines. Most developed OECD countries report much lower working hours (33 hours per week on average for OECD group),\" the EAC-PM note says. India is comparable to other emerging economies in terms of daily hours worked – which is significantly higher than the average number of hours worked in developed or rich economies, the paper says.

He drew attention towards the Chinese plan to construct the hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, near the Indian border, which can generate 60,000 MW of power. The river enters Arunachal Pradesh as Siang and becomes the Brahmaputra in Assam before flowing into Bangladesh. related stories “If China uses it as a water bomb, it will completely affect the Adi tribe (who reside in the Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh) and millions in Assam and as far as Bangladesh. It’s a matter of big concern,\" said Khandu while addressing the reporters on the sidelines of the inaugural function of a seminar titled ‘Environment and Security’ in the state Legislative Assembly complex. Noting that the project would have a devastating effect on Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, he said that any sudden releases of water from the dam could cause severe flooding downstream in the northeastern states. He added that it was more worrying since China is not a signatory of global treaties on water. “The mighty Siang or the Brahmaputra river would dry up during winters disrupting life in the Siang belt and the plains of Assam,\" he warned. “China’s construction of the world’s largest hydropower dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo River poses significant risks to the water security, ecology, and livelihoods of millions of people downstream in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, and Bangladesh.

After extending the deadline twice, a total of 18 applications were received for the position. related stories However, the health ministry has asked for more time from the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) for the selection process. In a memorandum titled “Re-employment of Dr. Rajeev Singh Raghuvanshi as Drugs Controller (India), Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on contract basis\", the health ministry informed about the tenure extension on January 17. The document has been accessed by News18. The current regulator, Dr Rajeev Singh Raghuvanshi, is set to superannuate on February 28. Requesting “considerable time\" to “thoroughly scrutinise\" the applications, the ministry told the ACC that Raghuvanshi’s in-depth knowledge of industry, government regulatory systems, and international pharmaceutical dynamics is an asset for the organisation. DCGI is the head of the country’s apex health regulatory body, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which is responsible for the regulation, manufacturing, sales, export and import of all medicines, cosmetics, vaccines and medical devices in India. It is also responsible for various other factors, including the preparation and maintenance of the national reference standards and implementation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. Why extension for DCGI? Raghuvanshi took charge as DCGI on February 23, 2023. He was also assigned the additional charge of the post of secretary-cum-scientific director, Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC). In anticipation of Raghuvanshi’s vacancy, the post for DCGI was advertised in August 2024. However, due to inadequate response, the last date for submission of applications was extended to November 23. Despite the considerably long application period, a total of 18 applications have been received in response to the advertisements. “These applications are being scrutinised. Thereafter, a proposal will be submitted to UPSC for selection of a suitable candidate for the post. The entire process is likely to take considerable time,\" the ministry of health and family welfare wrote in an office memorandum sent to the ACC. Ministry praises DCGI, calls him an ‘asset’ The ministry further clarified on the re-employment that the current DCGI is capable of running this position effectively and, in fact, keeping the position vacant would adversely impact the industry. “Dr Raghuvanshi has in-depth knowledge of industry, government regulatory systems and international pharmaceutical dynamics, which is an asset for the organisation,\" it said. The document recognises Raghuvanshi’s efforts and initiatives taken at CDSCO. “Under his able leadership, substantial reforms have been brought out in CDSCO. At present, further regulatory reforms are being undertaken in CDSCO, which include global benchmarking, automation of the regulatory processes and alignment with global standards,\" it said. The document further stated that “keeping in view the importance of activities being undertaken by CDSCO, the post cannot be kept vacant as the same would adversely impact the country’s effort to develop a world-class pharmaceutical ecosystem consisting of components from production of affordable quality generics to latest technology-based products like CAR-Ts and gene therapies for India and the world\". It concluded by saying that “continuity in leadership in CDSCO is, therefore, necessary\".

Justice Sachin Datta however underlined that tabling of the audit reports was mandatory under the Constitution and directed the reports to be placed in the assembly by Delhi government after the elections as expeditiously as possible. related stories “In such a situation (when the current legislative assembly is about to expire), it would be impracticable to hold a special sitting of the assembly… Given that the legislative assembly is at the fag end of its current term, the examination and scrutiny by the PAC (public accounts committee) will now take place only after the newly-elected assembly is re-convened,\" the order said. The court is not inclined to accept the prayers of the petitioners that a mandamus be issued to the speaker for summoning a special session of the legislative assembly at this stage, it added. The court observed an “inordinate delay\" by the AAP government in laying the CAG reports in the assembly and the timeline revealed a “disdainful disregard\" of its constitutional obligations. The court therefore directed once the legislative assembly was constituted and summoned pursuant to the elections, steps should be taken by Delhi government under the procedural rules for tabling the CAG reports as expeditiously as possible.

Blackman said that there are opinions in the country that the film is “anti-Sikh\", however, said that the people watching the movie should be the ones to judge and not be “threatened by thugs who want to disrupt democratic opportunities to see public films\". top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “May we have a statement from the Home Secretary next week on what will be done to ensure that people who want to see such films, which have been passed by censors, can do so in peace and harmony?

Born into a simple farming family, Sunil was known for his sharp mind and strong physique. His early education took place in the village school, and he later attended a school in Mawana for higher studies, eventually completing his graduation. Initially inclined towards farming, Sunil’s fascination with the police uniform set him on a different path. Joining the UP Police, he quickly made a name for himself through his discipline and resolve. His excellence during the 2008 encounter of Ambika Patel, alias Thokia, earned him an out-of-turn promotion from head constable to sub-inspector. This milestone marked the beginning of an illustrious career in the STF.

(AP Photo) President Donald Trump on Friday used his executive authority to restore U.S. participation in two international anti-abortion pacts, including one that cuts off U.S. family planning funds for foreign organizations if they provide or promote abortions. Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, which opponents call the \"global gag rule\" because they say it silences abortion advocates. Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it has been rescinded by each Democratic president since then and reinstated when a Republican returns to the White House. related stories Abortion is a divisive issue in U.S. politics and was a major issue in the 2024 campaign won by Trump. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to eliminate a nationwide right to abortion, leaving abortion laws to each of the 50 states. Trump said in his memorandum on Friday he was directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to implement the Mexico City Policy \"to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\" Democrats and abortion rights advocates contend the rule disrupts other forms of healthcare access and blocks nongovernmental organizations abroad from receiving U.S. funds, even if they use their own money on abortion care. Janeen Madan Keller, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said research showed that the \"gag order\" has led to an increase in unwanted pregnancies and abortions, counter to its intended impact. \"Broadly speaking these decisions are going to really set the United States back in advancing gender equality,\" Madan Keller said, in part by limiting the ability of women and girls to complete school and enter the workforce. Rubio also announced on Friday the United States was rejoining the Geneva Consensus Declaration, which critics say aims to limit abortion access for millions of women and girls around the world. The declaration was co-sponsored by the United States, Brazil, Uganda, Egypt, Hungary and Indonesia in 2020, when Trump was in office during his first term. It now has more than 35 signatories. The previous Trump administration said the declaration sought better healthcare for women and the preservation of human life, while also strengthening family as the foundational unit of society and protecting each nation’s sovereignty. The State Department said on Friday that one of the four objectives of the pact was to \"protect life at all stages.\" top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Trump also issued an executive order related to the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion coverage in the United States, and rescinded two of predecessor Joe Biden’s executive orders intending to preserve reproductive health services after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion. \"While this EO (executive order) has no immediate impact, it is an indication of the Trump administration doubling down on denying abortion access to people with low incomes,\" the women’s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood said in a statement.

(AP photo) Mexico has refused a request from President Donald Trump’s administration to allow a U.S. military aircraft deporting migrants to land in the country, a U.S. official and a Mexican official told Reuters. U.S. military aircraft carried out two similar flights, each with about 80 migrants, to Guatemala on Friday. The government was not able to move ahead with a plan to have a C-17 transport aircraft land in Mexico, however, after the country denied permission. related stories A U.S. official and a Mexican official confirmed the decision, which was first reported by NBC News. Mexico’s foreign ministry, in a statement late on Friday, said the country had a “very great relationship\" with the U.S. and cooperated on issues such as immigration. “When it comes to repatriations, we will always accept the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open arms,\" the ministry said. The Mexican official did not give a reason for the denial of permission to land, while the foreign ministry did not mention the incident. Trump’s administration earlier this week announced it was re-launching the program known as “Remain in Mexico,\" which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their cases in the United States were resolved. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday such a move would require the country receiving the asylum-seekers to agree, and that Mexico had not done so. The U.S. State Department and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S.-Mexico relations have come into sharp focus since Trump started his second term on Monday with the declaration of a national emergency along the two nations’ shared border. He has ordered 1,500 additional U.S. troops there so far, and officials have said thousands more could deploy soon. The president has declared Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations, renamed the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America and threatened an across-the-board 25% duty on Mexican goods beginning in February. Sheinbaum has sought to avoid escalating the situation and expressed openness toward accommodating Mexican nationals who are returned. But the leftist leader has also said she does not agree with mass deportations and that Mexican immigrants are vital to the U.S. economy. The use of U.S. military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon’s response to Trump’s national emergency declaration on Monday. In the past, U.S. military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, like during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.

(IMAGE: REUTERS) The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary on Saturday, putting the South Dakota governor in charge of a sprawling agency that is essential to national security and President Donald Trump’s plans to clamp down on illegal immigration. Republicans kept the Senate working Saturday to install the latest member of Trump’s national security team. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was confirmed in a dramatic tie-breaking vote Friday night, joining Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. related stories The Senate will next vote Monday evening on Scott Bessent’s confirmation as treasury secretary. Noem, a Trump ally who is in her second term as governor, received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier in the week. Republicans, who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her, have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement. “Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans’ top priorities,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Friday. “And it’s going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security. I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.\" Democrats are split on how to handle border enforcement and immigration under Trump, with some warming to his hard-line stand. Still, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he would vote against Noem. He pointed to “bipartisan solutions to fix the mess at our border,\" adding that Noem “seems headed in the wrong direction.\" The homeland security secretary oversees US Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies, the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation, protecting dignitaries, responding to natural disasters and more. Trump is planning major changes to how the department functions, including involving the military in immigration enforcement and reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those plans could immediately put Noem in the spotlight after the new president visited recent disaster sites in North Carolina and California on Friday. During her Senate hearing, Noem was repeatedly asked by Democratic senators whether she would administer disaster aid to states even if Trump asked her not to. Noem avoided saying she would defy the president, but she told lawmakers, “I will deliver the programs according to the law and that it will be done with no political bias.\" Six people cycled through as homeland security secretary during Trump’s first four years in office. Noem, who held her state’s lone US House seat for eight years before becoming governor in 2019, has risen in the GOP by tacking closely with Trump. At one point, she was even under consideration to be his running mate. Her political stock took a momentary dip, however, when she released a book last year containing an account of her killing her hunting dog, as well as a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. If confirmed, she would be tasked with delivering on Trump’s favorite issue, border security. The president’s goals of deporting millions of people who entered the country illegally could put Noem, with her experience governing a rural state and growing up on a farm, in a difficult position. In South Dakota, many migrants, some in the country without permanent legal status, power the labor-heavy jobs that produce food and housing.

The plane first communicated with the air traffic control tower at 8:54:43 am as it was approaching for landing. The control tower cleared it for landing on Runway 01, in the opposite direction of the runway where the accident happened. At 8:57:50 am, the control tower issued a warning to the aircraft about a potential bird strike. At 8:58:11 am, the captain and first officer talked about a flock of birds flying below the aircraft. The recording appears to have stopped at 8:58:50 am, suggesting that the plane probably lost power after both engines were shut down due to the bird strikes. Feathers and blood, apparently of a type of winter migratory ducks, were found on both engines, the ministry said. The pilot is believed to have declared the emergency “mayday\" distress call at 8:58:56 am, but this is an estimate made through synchronization with the control tower records, as no recording of it remains in the black box, the ministry said.

(Reuters) As US President Donald Trump began his promised deportation campaign, a war of words erupted between Trump’s border czar Tom Homan and Pope Francis after the pontiff expressed disapproval of the plan to deport millions of illegal immigrants. The deportation blitz began as Trump signed executive orders that gave immigration officers extraordinary new powers to conduct fast-track deportations on a large scale in several cities. Moreover, the US President even scrapped restrictions that kept “sensitive\" locations like churches and schools off-limits for immigration officers, according to The Washington Post. related stories Shortly before Trump’s inauguration, Pope Francis said his plans to impose mass deportations of immigrants would be a “disgrace\", nearly a decade after calling him “not Christian\" for wanting to build a wall along the US-Mexican border. During an appearance at an evening talk show, Francis said, “If true, this will be a disgrace, because it makes the poor wretches who have nothing pay the bill\" for the problem, Francis said. “This won’t do! This is not the way to solve things. That’s not how things are resolved.\" Trump Official Accuses Pope Of ‘Hypocrisy’ In a televised interview, Homan accused the Pope of hypocrisy, pointing towards a wall around the Vatican for safety measures. “They have a wall around the Vatican.

That’s a mess,\" he said. Meanwhile, Trump’s immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) department arrested 538 people on Thursday, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and officials said 593 more people were arrested on Friday. “The largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway,\" Leavitt wrote on X on Thursday. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “Deportation flights have begun.

Many US bishops have firmly opposed Trump’s deportation plan, with the incoming archbishop of Washington DC, Cardinal Robert McElroy, saying such policies were “incompatible with Catholic doctrine\".

(AFP) A German aerospace engineer celebrated setting a world record Friday for the longest time living underwater without depressurisation — 120 days in a submerged capsule off the coast of Panama. Rudiger Koch, 59, emerged from his 30-square-meter (320-square-foot) home under the sea in the presence of Guinness World Records adjudicator Susana Reyes. related stories She confirmed that Koch had beaten the record previously held by American Joseph Dituri, who spent 100 days living in an underwater lodge in a Florida lagoon. “It was a great adventure and now it’s over there’s almost a sense of regret actually. I enjoyed my time here very much,\" Koch told AFP after leaving the capsule 11 meters (36 feet) under the sea. “It is beautiful when things calm down and it gets dark and the sea is glowing,\" he said of the view through the portholes. “It is impossible to describe, you have to experience that yourself,\" he added. To celebrate, Koch toasted with champagne and smoked a cigar before leaping into the Caribbean Sea, where a boat picked him up and took him to dry land for a celebratory party. Koch’s capsule had most of the trappings of modern life: a bed, toilet, TV, computer and internet — even an exercise bike. Located some 15 minutes by boat from the coast of northern Panama, it was attached to another chamber perched above the waves by a tube containing a narrow spiral staircase, providing a way down for food and visitors, including a doctor. Solar panels on the surface provided electricity. There was a backup generator, but no shower. Koch had told an AFP journalist who visited him halfway through his endeavour that he hoped it would change the way we think about human life — and where we can settle, even permanently. “What we are trying to do here is prove that the seas are actually a viable environment for human expansion,\" he said. Four cameras filmed his moves in the capsule — capturing his daily life, monitoring his mental health and providing proof that he never came up to the surface. “We needed witnesses who were monitoring and verifying 24/7 for more than 120 days,\" Reyes told AFP. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The record “is undoubtedly one of the most extravagant\" and required “a lot of work,\" she added.

(AFP photo) Hamas released four young female Israeli soldiers on Saturday after more than 15 months in captivity. The release of the four comes days into a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and is part of a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Liri Albag were captured when Hamas-led militants overran the Nahal Oz military base during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war, killing over 60 soldiers there. related stories A fifth female soldier in their unit, Agam Berger, 20, was abducted with them but not included in the release. Video of the abduction of the five female soldiers, who had worked as spotters monitoring threats along the border, was widely circulated. Israel and Hamas have agreed in the ceasefire’s first phase to a gradual release of 33 hostages in Gaza, in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Three hostages were released previously during this truce in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The truce and release of hostages has sparked both hope and fear among Israelis. Many worry that the ceasefire could collapse before all the hostages return, or that those released will arrive in poor health. Others worry that the number of captives who have died is higher than expected. Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered 15 months of war. More than 90 hostages remain in Gaza, although at least a third are believed to be dead. The others were released, rescued, or their bodies were recovered. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says more than half were women or children. Here’s a look at the hostages released so far: Four hostages, all female soldiers were released on Saturday. Liri Albag was featured in a video Hamas released in early January, filmed under duress. Her family said the video was “difficult to watch\" because of Albag’s clear emotional distress. They were particularly active in the protest movement pushing for a deal with Hamas to bring the hostages home. “Liri, if you’re hearing us, tell the others that all the families are moving heaven and earth and want their children home, and we will fight until all hostages are returned,\" her father said in a statement after the video was released. Just before Karina Ariev was kidnapped, she she sent a message to her family, saying: “If I don’t live, take care of mom and dad all their lives. Don’t give up, live,\" according to Israeli media. Her family said she loves to cook, sing, dance and write poetry. In January 2024, she was featured in a video along with Gilboa and Doron Steinbrecher, who was released last weekend. After the kidnapping, her parents changed her name from Danielle to Daniella, a Jewish tradition that is believed to bring God’s protection. In video of the kidnapping, Gilboa seems to have a foot injury as she is forced into the jeep that took her to Gaza. Gilboa, from Petah Tikva, a suburb of Tel Aviv, played piano and studied music in high school. She dreams of being a singer, according to Israeli media. The footage from Levy’s kidnapping, in which she is wearing gray sweatpants covered in blood, was shown around the world. Levy is a triathlete. When she was younger, she participated in the “Hands of Peace\" delegation, which brings together Americans, Israelis and Palestinians to work on coexistence. From footage of the kidnappings, it seems that Levy was taken separately from the other lookout soldiers, leading her family to worry she was in captivity alone for much of the time. The following three hostages were released on Jan. 19, the first day of the ceasefire: Romi Gonen was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That morning, Gonen’s mother, Merav, and her eldest daughter spent nearly five hours speaking to Gonen as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Gonen told her family that roads clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible and that she would seek shelter in some bushes. Over the past 15 months, Merav Gonen has been one of the most outspoken voices advocating for the return of the hostages, appearing nearly daily on Israeli news programs and traveling abroad on missions.

(Reuters) China’s veteran foreign minister has issued a veiled warning to America’s new secretary of state: Behave yourself. Foreign Minister Wang Yi conveyed the message in a phone call Friday, their first conversation since Marco Rubio’s confirmation as President Donald Trump’s top diplomat four days earlier. related stories “I hope you will act accordingly,\" Wang told Rubio, according to a Foreign Ministry statement, employing a Chinese phrase typically used by a teacher or a boss warning a student or employee to behave and be responsible for their actions. The short phrase seemed aimed at Rubio’s vocal criticism of China and its human rights record when he was a US senator, which prompted the Chinese government to put sanctions on him twice in 2020. It can be translated in various ways — in the past, the Foreign Ministry has used “make the right choice\" and “be very prudent about what they say or do\" rather than “act accordingly.\" The vagueness allows the phrase to express an expectation and deliver a veiled warning, while also maintaining the courtesy necessary for further diplomatic engagement, said Zichen Wang, a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a Chinese think tank. “What could appear to be confusing is thus an intended effect originating from Chinese traditional wisdom and classic practice of speech,\" said Wang, who is currently in a mid-career master’s program at Princeton University. Rubio, during his confirmation hearing, cited the importance of referring to the original Chinese to understand the words of China’s leader Xi Jinping. “Don’t read the English translation that they put out because the English translation is never right,\" he said. A U.S. statement on the phone call didn’t mention the phrase. It said Rubio told Wang that the Trump administration would advance U.S. interests in its relationship with China and expressed “serious concern over China’s coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\" top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Wang was foreign minister in 2020 when China slapped sanctions on Rubio in July and August, first in response to US sanctions on Chinese officials for a crackdown on the Uyghur minority in the Xinjiang region and then over what it regarded as outside interference in Hong Kong.

This comes at a time when military and financial assistance from the U.S. to Ukraine has been a subject of debate within U.S. politics, with some figures calling for a reduction in aid or changes to U.S. policy toward Ukraine.The statement by Donald Trump could be highlighting his perspective on this situation, potentially in relation to his own position on U.S. involvement in the war or on foreign aid more broadly.00:00 INTRODUCTION03:22 USAID ‘FREEZES’ PROJECTS SUPPORTING UKRAINE n18oc_crux",

Responding to this, Putin said that he did not expect Trump to make decisions on sanctions that would rebound on the US economy. “Therefore, most likely, it would be better for us to meet, based on the realities of today, to talk calmly on all those areas that are of interest to both the United States and Russia. We are ready,\" Putin said. Putin On US Poll Outcome In 2020 Putin also claimed that the Ukraine crisis in 2022 might not have happened if Trump had been the US President at the time. “I cannot but agree with him that if he had been president — if his victory hadn’t been stolen in 2020 — then maybe there would not have been the crisis in Ukraine that emerged in 2022,\" he said.

He, however, said that he did not believe Trump would force global oil prices lower in an attempt to damage Moscow. “He is not only a smart person, but a pragmatic person. The oil prices were either too high or too low that were bad for both the Russian and American economies.

As a fragile six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas entered its sixth day, Israelis waited anxiously for the names of the next four hostages who will be released from among the more than 90 still held in Gaza. related stories In the Palestinian enclave, civilians in the central and southern part of the Gaza Strip hoping to return to the remnants of their home in the battered north faced an agonizing wait. Israel believes about a third, or possibly as many as half, of the more than 90 hostages still in Gaza have died. Hamas has not released definitive information on how many captives are still alive or the names of those who have died. “Dear President Trump, first of all we want to say thank you for the happy moments we felt this week. But we want to tell you we still have 94 hostages, we need them all at home,\" said Ayelet Samerano, whose son Yonatan Samerano is among those still being held. “Please do not stop. Please continue to press and do everything so that all the 94 hostages will come home immediately.\" In the first phase of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages are expected to be released gradually in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The first three Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, the first day of the ceasefire that has halted the 15-month war that has devastated Gaza. Wide swathes of the territory have been destroyed, while more than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not differentiate between combatants and civilians but say more than half are women and children. According to the deal, on Friday Hamas is to announce the names of the next four hostages to be released on Saturday, after which Israel will also release a list of which Palestinian prisoners will be freed. The hostages were among about 250 men, women and children captured by militants who burst across the border into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people in an attack that sparked the war in Gaza. About 100 were released during a brief ceasefire in November that year, while the bodies of around three dozen hostages have been recovered in Gaza and eight hostages have been rescued by the army. “I call from here to the Prime Minister and negotiating team — you’re doing excellent work — do whatever is necessary to bring everyone back, to the last hostage,\" Samerano said. “We ask you to ensure phase two of the deal is agreed upon before finishing the current phrase. We cannot continue living in uncertainty. All hostages must return, and none of them has time left.\" The 33 to be released in the first phase will include women, children, sick people and those over 50 — almost all civilians, though the deal also commits Hamas to freeing all living female soldiers in Phase 1. Hamas will release living hostages first, but could release some bodies if they don’t have enough living hostages in this category. Male soldiers are not expected to be released in the first phase. “This week we were moved to watch images of mothers embracing their daughters, but our hearts break thinking that my son Nimrod and other men remain behind, and each day they’re there poses a real danger to their lives,\" said Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod Cohen is among the hostages. “The worry that the deal won’t be fully implemented gnaws at us all. All senior officials openly say that stopping the deal means a death sentence for those left behind.\" Under the terms of the deal, Palestinians in Gaza will have more freedom of movement from the north to the south of the enclave. Civilians in the south will be allowed to take a coastal road to northern Gaza from Saturday, when Israeli troops are expected to withdraw from the key route and Hamas is set to release the next four Israeli hostages. Those in other parts of the strip seized on the ceasefire this week to reunite with scattered family members, picking their way through vast swaths of rubble and trying to salvage what remained of their homes and their belongings. But those displaced from the north have had to wait. “The first thing I’ll do, I’ll kiss the dirt of the land on which I was born and raised,\" said Nadia Al-Debs, one of the many people gathered in makeshift tents in Gaza’s...",

While the price of salt is relatively low in some countries, it is significantly higher in others. For example, Korean bamboo salt, the most expensive salt in the world, costs Rs 7,500 for 250 grams due to its unique production process. related stories Salt’s Role in Indian History Salt played a pivotal role in India’s freedom struggle. During British rule, it was an expensive commodity. Today, in India, salt is relatively inexpensive, priced at Rs 20–Rs 25 per kilogram. However, in countries like the United States, salt can be far more costly. Korean Bamboo Salt Korean bamboo salt, also known as purple bamboo salt or Jugyeom , is created through an intricate process. It has been used in Korean cuisine and traditional medicine for centuries. The salt comes with a unique process: Filling bamboo cylinders with sea salt. Roasting the salt nine times at temperatures exceeding 800°C, with the final roasting reaching up to 1,000°C. Infusing the salt with minerals from the bamboo during this roasting. This labour-intensive process spans 50 days and requires specialised furnaces and skilled artisans, making it exceptionally expensive. Health Benefits of Bamboo Salt Bamboo salt is rich in over 70 essential minerals, including potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Its reported health benefits include: Anti-inflammatory properties: Reduces inflammation, aiding conditions like arthritis and sore throats. Oral health: Treats mouth ulcers and swollen gums, promoting oral hygiene. Alkaline effect: Helps balance the body’s pH levels, potentially reducing the risk of diseases like cancer. Antioxidant activity: Eliminates free radicals, which contribute to chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. Immune boosting: Enhances the immune system through its antibacterial properties. Toxin neutraliser: Improves overall health by neutralising toxins. Skin health: Prevents infections and improves conditions like eczema. Stress relief: Promotes relaxation by balancing hormones. Digestive health: Supports gut health, though further research is needed. Global Salt Pricing Salt prices vary worldwide due to factors like production methods, transportation costs, and market demand. For instance: Expensive salt-producing countries are: Ghana Switzerland Belgium Affordable salt-producing countries: India Pakistan Kazakhstan Egypt In countries like India, salt production is inexpensive due to its extensive coastline and government subsidies. Conversely, in nations like the United States, salt is among the costliest, approximately Rs 300 per kg.

Our understanding is that Bangladesh will approach this… pic.twitter.com/LH3TsZaxON — IANS (@ians_india) January 24, 2025 Jaiswal’s remarks on border fencing came in the wake of the recent stabbing of Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan, allegedly carried out by a man said to be a Bangladesh national who was staying in India illegally. The incident, which took place during an attempted burglary at Khan’s private residence in Bandra on January 16, has sparked discussions on illegal immigration, especially from Bangladesh. The attack on the actor has brought attention to security concerns and the importance of tackling illegal immigration to prevent such incidents. Jibe At Pakistan Over Cross-Border Terrorism In response to a statement from Pakistan’s ISPR, which accused India of politicising its army, the the MEA spokesperson reiterated that the world is fully aware of the origins of cross-border terrorism. “The whole world knows who is promoting terrorism. In India, when we have terror-related attacks, we all understand the genesis and root of cross-border terrorism,\" Jaiswal stated. The statement follows the Indian Army’s comments on the terror activities in Jammu and Kashmir, which have been linked to Pakistan. Jaiswal also said that making claims of politicisation is irrelevant. “So in this context, when the whole world knows who is the progenitor of cross-border terrorism, to say that we are trying to politicise something, etc., is totally immaterial,\" he added. He further called on Pakistan to take concrete steps to stop cross-border terrorism, stating that everyone is aware of the countries and individuals responsible for promoting such violence. On Foreign Secretary’s Upcoming China Visit Regarding the upcoming visit of Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri to China on January 26 and 27, Jaiswal said that Misri will meet with China’s Vice Minister, and discussions will cover all areas of bilateral interest between the two countries. The MEA spokesperson also mentioned that the outcomes of the discussions would be shared after the meetings take place. He assured that all issues of shared interest would be covered, though specifics will only be available once the meetings have concluded. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “This meeting flows from the understanding that the leaders reached in Kazan, and subsequent to that, we’ve had meetings at the special representatives level, and we’ve had foreign minister-level meetings as well.

Trump had harsher words for Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan, accusing the firm and others of refusing to do business with conservatives. “You’ve done a fantastic job,\" Trump said, before adding: “I hope you’re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you’re doing is wrong.\" MILEI PRAISE Trump is always a top draw in Davos, making waves at two previous in-person appearances during his first term in 2018 and 2020. But showing up this year was tougher as the forum happened to start on the day of his inauguration in Washington on Monday. Scores stood in line to hear him speak. Some in the audience included IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva, European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde, Polish President Andrzej Duda and World Trade Organization head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. One of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders on the world stage, Argentina’s libertarian President Javier Milei, took the stage hours before Trump, delivering a fiery speech against “the mental virus of woke ideology\". Milei said Argentina was “re-embracing the idea of freedom\" and “that is what I trust President Trump will do in this new America\". He also defended his “dear friend\" Elon Musk. The US billionaire and Trump ally caused a stir this week by making hand gestures at an inauguration event for the US president that drew comparisons to the Nazi salute. Milei said Musk, the head of Tesla and SpaceX, has been “unfairly vilified by wokeism in recent hours for an innocent gesture that only means… his gratitude to the people\". LET’s NOT HYPERVENTILATE Trump had already given Davos a taste of what was to come since his inauguration on Monday, which coincided with the WEF’s first day. He has threatened tariffs on China, the European Union, Mexico and Canada, pulled the United States from the Paris climate pact and renewed his claim to the Panama Canal, just to name a few. Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO chief, called on cooler heads to prevail during a WEF panel discussion on tariffs on Thursday, warning that tit-for-tat levies would be “catastrophic\" for the world economy. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “Please let’s not hyperventilate,\" she quipped. “I know we are here to discuss tariffs.

(Representative/Shutterstock) A recent report by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has raised concerns, revealing that at least 242 million children across 85 countries experienced educational disruptions due to extreme weather events, including heatwaves, cyclones, and floods. The UNICEF report, as cited by the Associated Press, mentioned that in 2021, one in every seven school-going children worldwide missed school at some point due to climate hazards. The report also stated that hundreds of schools in some countries were destroyed due to extreme weather, especially in low-income countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. related stories The report stated that torrential rain and flooding disrupted more than 900,000 children’s studies in Italy at the end of 2021. Thousands of children also had to miss classes after devastating floods in Spain. While southern Europe suffered deadly floods and Asia and Africa were hit by floods and cyclones, heatwaves were the “leading climate threat closing schools last year\" as the Earth experienced its hottest year on record. UNICEF said more than 118 million children’s studies were disrupted in April alone, as large parts of the Middle East and Asia, from Gaza in the west to the Philippines in the southeast, suffered a week-long scorching heatwave that saw temperatures soar above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). “Children are more vulnerable to the effects of climate-related crises, including stronger and more frequent heatwaves, storms, droughts and floods. Their bodies are uniquely sensitive: they heat up faster, sweat less effectively, and cool down more slowly than adults. Children cannot concentrate in classrooms that do not provide relief from scorching heat, and they cannot get to school if the path is flooded or the school is washed away,\" UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement. Almost three-quarters (74%) of children affected by climate change in 2021 lived in middle- and low-income countries, according to the UNICEF report. The report highlights the devastating impact of climate extremes on the world’s poorest nations. In April, floods in Pakistan resulted in the destruction of over 400 schools. Similarly, Afghanistan experienced a heatwave in May followed by severe flooding, leading to the destruction of more than 110 schools. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Months of drought in southern Africa, exacerbated by the El Niño weather phenomenon, have placed the education and futures of millions of children at risk, and the crises show no signs of abating.

Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr reset Follow us on Google News US President Donald Trump directed officials to declassify files on the assassination of president John F. Kennedy. (Courtesy: Reuters) United States President Donald Trump ordered the declassification on Thursday of the last secret files on the assassination of former president John F. Kennedy, a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death. Trump signed an executive order that will also release documents on the 1960s assassinations of JFK’s younger brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. related stories “That’s big one, huh? A lot of people have been waiting for this for years, for decades,\" Trump told reporters as he signed the order in the Oval Office of the White House. “Everything will be revealed,\" he said. After signing the order, Trump passed the pen he used to an aide, saying “Give that to RFK Jr.,\" JFK’s nephew and the current president’s nominee to become secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The order Trump signed requires the “full and complete release\" of the JFK files, without redactions that he accepted back in 2017 when releasing most of the documents. “It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,\" the order said. Trump had previously promised to release the last of the files, most recently at his inauguration on Monday. ‘Overwhelming Evidence’ The US National Archives has released tens of thousands of records in recent years related to the November 22, 1963 assassination of Kennedy but held thousands back, citing national security concerns. It said at the time of the latest large-scale release, in December 2022, that 97% of the Kennedy records – which total five million pages – had now been made public. The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy’s murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories. Trump’s move is partly a gesture to one of the most prominent backers of those conspiracies — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself. RFK Jr. said in 2023 there was “overwhelming evidence the CIA was involved\" in his uncle JFK’s murder and “very convincing\" evidence the agency was also behind the 1968 assassination of his own father, Robert F. Kennedy. The former attorney general was killed while campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president. Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-born Jordanian, was convicted of his murder. Anti-vaccine activist RFK Jr. was rewarded with the health nod in Trump’s cabinet for dropping his independent presidential bid and backing the Republican, but he faces a rocky nomination process. Conspiracy Theories Thousands of Kennedy assassination-related documents from the National Archives were released during Trump’s first term in office, but he also held some back on national security grounds. Then-president Joe Biden said at the time of the December 2022 documents release that a “limited\" number of files would continue to be held back at the request of unspecified “agencies.\" Previous requests to withhold documents have come from the CIA and FBI. Kennedy scholars have said the documents still held by the archives are unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th US president. Oswald, who had at one point defected to the Soviet Union, was shot to death two days after killing Kennedy by a nightclub owner, Jack Ruby, as he was being transferred from the city jail. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Hundreds of books and movies such as the 1991 Oliver Stone film “JFK\" have fueled the conspiracy industry, pointing the finger at Cold War rivals Russia or Cuba, the Mafia and even Kennedy’s vice president, Lyndon Johnson. Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in April 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray was convicted of the murder and died in prison in 1998 but King’s children have expressed doubts in the past that Ray was the assassin.

(Courtesy: Reuters) As the deadline for United States President Donald Trump’s executive order for ending automatic birthright citizenship to the children of non-permanent residents approaches, a lot of expectant Indian women are rushing for preterm C-sections so that their children are born before the deadline of February 20. The women are opting for C-sections in their eighth or ninth month of pregnancy and not waiting to complete their full term, reported The Times Of India. related stories Donald Trump, after swearing in as the 47th President of the United States Monday, signed a flurry of executive orders among which ended ‘birthright citizenship’ – a 127-year-old amendment made to the Constitution that ensured American nationality to all children born in the country irrespective of whether their parents hold citizenship or not. The order has also been contested in various lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states and civil rights groups. How Citizenship Birthright Amendment Is Impacting Indian Families? The drastic amendment in citizenship birthright is being felt by Indian families, who are on temporary H1B or L1 visas. In the United States, doctors and gynaecologists have reported that pregnant Indian women who are on such visas have been rushing to the clinics and consulting about caesarean for making pre-term delivery of their children before the new mandate goes into effect on February 20. The women are rushing because all children born before the deadline will be given citizenship and those born afterwards will only get citizenship if one of their parents is a Green Card holder or after they turn 21. Speaking to The Times Of India, Dr SD Rama from New Jersey said that a lot of women came to her with requests for preterm deliveries. “A seven-month pregnant woman came, with her husband, to sign up for a pre-term delivery. She isn’t due until sometime in March,\" she said. The Indian parents are in a panic because several lakhs of them had earlier believed that their children would become American citizens automatically, however, that may not be the case. The amendment will not impact Green Card holders whose children will be born as American citizens even after February 20. What Is Birthright Citizenship In The US? In the United States, anyone born is considered a citizen of the country at birth, as per the law which has now been amended. It has been derived from the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment which was part of the Constitution in 1868. “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,\" states the amendment. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all In the United States, currently, 13-14 million immigrants are living illegally and currently their children are considered American citizens if born in the country. tags : donald trump united states president Location : Washington D.C., United States of America (USA) First Published: January 24, 2025, 07:33 IST News world Indians Rush For C-Sections As Deadline Of Trump's Birthright Citizenship Order Approaches Read More",

Trump had signed the order on Monday, his first day back in office. related stories The judge, an appointee of Republican former President Ronald Reagan, dealt the first legal setback to the hardline policies on immigration that are a centerpiece of Trump’s second term as president. “Obviously we’ll appeal,\" Trump said of Coughenour’s ruling. Trump’s executive order had directed US agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the United States if neither their mother nor father is a US citizen or lawful permanent resident. “I am having trouble understanding how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this order is constitutional,\" the judge told a US Justice Department lawyer defending Trump’s order. “It just boggles my mind.\" The states argued that Trump’s order violated the right enshrined in the citizenship clause of the US Constitution’s 14th Amendment which provides that anyone born in the United States is a citizen. “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,\" Coughenour said of Trump’s policy. Coughenour’s order, announced following a short hearing in a packed courtroom with other judges watching, prevents Trump’s policy from being enforced nationwide for 14 days while the judge considers whether to issue a long-lasting preliminary injunction. He will hear arguments over whether to do so on February 6. Under Trump’s order, any children born in the United States after February 19 whose mother and father are not American citizens or lawful permanent residents would be subject to deportation and would be prevented from obtaining Social Security numbers, various government benefits and the ability as they get older to work lawfully. “Under this order, babies being born today don’t count as US citizens,\" Washington state Assistant Attorney General Lane Polozola, referring to Trump’s policy, told the judge during the hearing. Justice Department lawyer Brett Shumate argued that Trump’s action was constitutional and called any judicial order blocking it “wildly inappropriate.\" But before Shumate had even finished responding to Polozola’s argument, Coughenour said he had signed the temporary restraining order. ‘VIGOROUSLY DEFEND’ The Justice Department plans to file papers next week to urge the judge not to issue a longer injunction, Shumate said. A Justice Department spokesperson said it plans to continue to “vigorously defend\" Trump’s order. “We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the court and to the American people, who are desperate to see our nation’s laws enforced,\" the spokesperson said. Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, a Democrat, said he sees no reason to expect that the Justice Department would succeed in overturning Coughenour’s ruling on appeal, even if the matter goes to the US Supreme Court, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump. “You are an American citizen if you were born on American soil – period,\" Brown said. “Nothing that the president can do will change that.\" More than 150,000 newborn children would be denied citizenship annually if Trump’s order is allowed to stand, according to the Democratic-led states. Since Trump signed the order, at least six lawsuits have been filed challenging it, most of them by civil rights groups and Democratic attorneys general from 22 states. Democratic state attorneys general have said that the understanding of the Constitution’s citizenship clause was cemented 127 years ago when the US Supreme Court ruled that children born in the United States to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 following the US Civil War, overturned the Supreme Court’s notorious 1857 Dred Scott decision that had declared that the Constitution’s protections did not apply to enslaved Black people. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all In a brief filed late on Wednesday, the Justice Department called t...",

Israeli officials have described the parade of jubilant Hamas fighters that celebrated the ceasefire on Sunday in front of cheering crowds as a carefully orchestrated attempt to exaggerate the Palestinian militant group’s strength. But, in the days since the ceasefire took effect, Gaza’s Hamas-run administration has moved quickly to reimpose security, to curb looting, and to start restoring basic services to parts of the enclave, swathes of which have been reduced to wasteland by the Israeli offensive. Residents, officials, regional diplomats and security experts told news agencies that despite Israel’s vow to destroy it, Hamas remains deeply entrenched in Gaza and its hold on power represents a challenge to implementing a permanent ceasefire.

The word “heil\" is seen projected onto the factory near Berlin in the font of the automaker’s logo, to spell the message “Heil Tesla\", a reference to the Nazi greeting that honoured Adolf Hitler. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Led By Donkeys (@ledbydonkeys) Philipp Ruch, founder of the Center for Political Beauty, said in comments to AFP that Musk had given “a Hitler salute, just like American neo-Nazis have been practising for years\". Musk has rejected as “dirty tricks\" and “propaganda\" any comparisons between the Nazi salute and his gesture, which he repeated and accompanied with the words “my heart goes out to you\" to the audience. Musk has already drawn criticism in Germany for his vocal support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and repeatedly insulting German political leaders on his X social media platform. With Germany in the midst of an election campaign, Musk has described the AfD as the “last ray of hope for the country\". He also hosted a discussion with AfD top candidate Alice Weidel on X. The anti-immigration party is polling in second place ahead of the February 23 election, at around 20 percent. But it is unlikely to enter government because other parties have ruled out cooperation with the AfD, parts of which are treated by domestic intelligence as far-right extremist organisations. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, asked about Musk on Tuesday, said that Germany guarantees free speech but stressed that “what we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions\". The Tesla factory in Germany has been targeted by protestors in the past on environmental grounds. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all In November, police cleared a protest camp in woods near the plant, where activists sought to block the site’s planned extension.

Meta had challenged the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) directive issued in November that imposed a ban on data sharing between WhatsApp and other Meta entities for advertising purposes, warning it may have to roll back some features. Meta also criticized the CCI for not having the “technical expertise\" to understand the ramifications of its order. related stories On Thursday, India’s National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ordered a suspension of the data sharing ban while it continues to hear Meta’s challenge to the antitrust ruling. The ban “may lead to a collapse\" of WhatsApp’s business model, the tribunal noted. India is the biggest market for Meta where it has more than 350 million Facebook users and over 500 million people using WhatsApp. Meta earlier told the appeals tribunal that it may have to “roll back or pause\" some features such as those that would allow an Indian fashion business, for example, to personalize ads on Facebook or Instagram based on their interaction with a WhatsApp user. Facebook’s registered entity engaged in selling advertising in India – Facebook India Online Services – reported revenue of $351 million in 2023-24, the highest in at least five years. A Meta spokesperson said it welcomed the ruling and “will evaluate next steps.\" The CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling, although the watchdog can challenge the decision in the Supreme Court if it wants to. In 2021, WhatsApp was accused of violating European Union laws by failing to clarify changes to its policy in plain and intelligible language. It later agreed to explain the changes to EU users.

(Courtesy: Reuters) NATO allies must pay their “fair share\" on defence before considering enlarging the alliance, a US presidential envoy hit out Thursday, in a retort to the NATO chief during an event in Davos, Switzerland. “You’re going to run into a big buzzsaw in America if we have the NATO secretary general talking about adding Ukraine to NATO,\" US envoy Richard Grenell said by video link at an event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. related stories “You cannot ask the American people to expand the umbrella of NATO when the current members aren’t paying their fair share, and that includes the Dutch who need to step up,\" Grenell said. He was speaking after NATO secretary general and former Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said minutes earlier that “full NATO membership is then the easiest outcome\" for Ukraine if a “sustainable\" peace is secured. Grenell also echoed US President Donald Trump’s call on NATO members to spend more on defence. “We need to make sure that those leaders are spending the right amount of money. We need to be able to avoid war. And that means a credible threat from NATO,\" he said. The envoy blasted Trump’s predecessor for not speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying the new US president was pressuring Ukraine and Russia “to the table\". “There’s a huge frustration from Americans that we’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars, and our leaders aren’t speaking to each other to try to solve problems,\" Grenell said. The transatlantic alliance’s 32 countries in 2023 set a minimum level for defence spending of 2% of gross domestic product, but Trump has suggested raising this to 5%.

(AP file photo) Saudi Arabia’s crown prince said Thursday the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Donald Trump earlier put a price tag on returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip. Trump’s 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration’s close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well. related stories The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Trump. “The crown prince affirmed the kingdom’s intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\" the report said. The readout did not elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which once was the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well. Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment. There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn’t immediately clear if Trump’s call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first reported abroad. The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday. On Monday after his inauguration, Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, like he did in 2017. “The first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but … I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\" Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. “If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 — we’ll up it for all the inflation — I think I’d probably go.\" The 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom. Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own. Global oil prices remain depressed years after the height of the coronavirus pandemic, affecting the kingdom’s revenues. Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed also wants to continue his $500 billion project at NEOM, a new city in Saudi Arabia’s western desert on the Red Sea. It also will need to build tens of billions of dollars’ worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of it hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.

On January 17, while preparations were underway for Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Kamala Harris’s staff packed into her ceremonial office to watch her sign the desk, a tradition performed by her predecessors for decades. All this while, her husband was seen standing behind her for a photo, as she wielded her Sharpie marker. related stories “It is not my nature to go quietly into the night,\" Harris told reporters, adding, “So don’t worry about that.\" “I’ll keep you posted,\" she said, upon being asked what was next for her. Many blamed Joe Biden for running in the first place and putting Harris in an impossible position. Harris faced her own criticism, too. Some said she should have sent a more populist message instead of focusing on Trump’s antidemocratic threats by campaigning with Liz Cheney, a former Republican congresswoman. She also failed to separate herself from Biden, who remains deeply unpopular with voters. Now, that Donald Trump has taken the President’s charge, Harris is apparently playing the blame game, and her target is her husband Doug Emhoff, whom she reportedly considers “dead weight\". Quoting a source, the Daily Mail reported that Doug has his share as far as Kamala’s blame game is concerned. “Doug did Kamala no favours during the election,\" the report quoted the source as saying. “Frankly, he looked like a hypocritical a** after the bombshells that he had got his child’s nanny pregnant while married to his first wife and assaulted his ex-girlfriend on the heels of his ‘I am woman’ crusade,\" the source added. The report also claimed that many people close to the couple believe that all is not well between the two, and this was reportedly observed while the couple appeared at former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral on January 9. Even as Donald Trump took charge as the President of the United States, Kamala Harris and her husband reflected a tense look, the report referred to some social media videos. It is also believed that Doug has already signed up for a job with a Big Apple law firm which would require them to split their time between New York and Los Angeles. There’s also talk that Harris will write a book and speculation that she could run for governor or maybe president again. At 60 years old, Harris is still young in a political world where the last two presidents have set records as the oldest ever elected. Many close to her believe she will skip the race for California governor and instead try for president again in 2028. “I was with her last week when she was signing her desk, she told me ‘You know me well enough to know that I’m not going to go away quietly’,\" the report quoted her former communications chief Ashley Etienne as saying. SCANDALS SURROUNDING HARRIS’s HUSBAND EMHOFF Earlier, the Daily Mail reported a series of allegations surrounding Emhoff. A source had told the publication that even Harris has had an affair with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown. In August, a report claimed that Emhoff had an affair with Najen Naylor, his daughter’s nanny, while still being married to his first wife, film producer Kerstin Mackin. Quoting a source, the report claimed Emhoff paid Naylor $80,000 in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement and that the affair played a part in his 2009 divorce. The controversy, however, didn’t end there. In October, a former girlfriend of Emhoff came forward, alleging a disturbing incident during an A-list event in Cannes, France, in May 2012, according to another report. She claimed Emhoff slapped her so hard in the face after he thought she was flirting with another man that the blow ‘spun her around,’ leaving her shocked and disoriented. Later, Emhoff reportedly admitted to having an extramarital affair, saying, “During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions.

Trump took office on January 20 after his swearing-in ceremony and signed a record number of executive orders, including pardons for the rioters who stormed into the Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the 2020 poll results which showed Trump defeated by Joe Biden. related stories The US President sat in an interview with Fox News ’ Sean Hannity. Donald Trump on J6 Rioters And Pardons Trump defended his pardon for almost 1,600 people convicted of crimes related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. His pardons were criticised widely, including by the police unions. “Most of the people were absolutely innocent, okay? Nobody’s ever been treated so badly. They were treated like the worst criminals in history. And you know what they were there for. They were protesting the vote because they knew the election was rigged.\" Trump said. Nearly 140 police officers sustained injuries in the Capitol riots. Donald Trump On Illegal Immigration Trump reiterated his claims that foreign countries are emptying their prisons to let criminals enter the US illegally. “They came out of jail from other countries. They’ve emptied their jails. I would if I were president or prime minister or something of another country. I’d empty my jails right into America, into the United States. Why not? And many of them did,\" the President said in the Fox News interview. Donald Trump On TikTok Ban In US Trump, who was a staunch critique of TikTok earlier and had termed it a “spying app\" for China, credited part of his 2024 poll success to his plans to reach out to the young voters using the Chinese app. When asked by the anchor why he allowed TikTok to continue to operate in the US, for which he signed an executive order soon after taking charge, Trump dismissed the concerns about the app’s risks. “Telephones and computers are made in China and so are a lot of other things. Isn’t that a bigger threat?\" he asked. He noted that young people like TikTok, stating that his youth numbers were high, and “maybe that’s because I went on TikTok\". Notably, Congress had banned the Chinese app in the US last year unless TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, sells it to the US. The ban was all set to come into effect starting Sunday (January 19). On its eve, TikTok suspended its services in the US briefly, only to be back online after Trump assured to sign an executive order directing the authorities to extend the period. Trump has directed the Justice Department not to enforce the ban for 75 days as his new administration chalks out a plan about the way ahead. The Supreme Court of the country had upheld the ban last week and therefore it is uncertain whether Trump’s direction will survive a court review. ‘Sad Biden Didn’t Give Himself A Pardon’: Trump top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Trump questioned why former President Joe Biden did not pardon himself before leaving office while he issued pardons for others. “You know, the funny thing — maybe the sad thing — is he didn’t give himself a pardon.

According to The Associated Press, marriage registration is customarily done at district offices, but on Thursday, around 300 couples are expected to complete the formalities at a daylong gala celebration in an exhibition hall at a shopping mall in central Bangkok. Hundreds more are predicted to register in less fancy circumstances around the country. The marriage equality bill, which sailed through both houses of the Parliament, amended the Civil and Commercial Code to change the words “men and women\" and “husband and wife\" to “individuals\" and “marriage partners\". It is supposed to open up access to full legal, financial and medical rights for LGBTQ+ couples. Partners will have equal rights and responsibilities in dealing with joint assets, tax obligations and deductions, inheritance rights and survivor benefits.

However, rights advocates have struggled for decades to pass a marriage equality law in a largely conservative society where members of the LGBTQ+ community say they face discrimination in everyday life, although they note that things have improved greatly in recent years, the AP reported. According to the report, Bangkok’s city government has said that it organised workshops for staff of all its district offices who are in charge of handling marriage registration.

The revelation comes after Ramaswamy, who was to co-head the new DOGE in Donald Trump’s government, announced hours after Trump’s inauguration as the 47th US President to not co-head the new department. He is reportedly planning to run for the Ohio Governor next week. related stories Differences Over H-1B Visas? Musk made it known that he wanted Ramaswamy out of DOGE in recent days due to “differences\", Politico reported citing three people close to the billionaire. Musk was expected to have a huge influence in the new Trump administration and the latest report is one such instance. Ramaswamy had reportedly irked some Republicans in Trump’s circle over H-1B visas. Ramaswamy’s “rant\" on X on H-1B visas led to his departure, according to the report. Notably, both Musk and Ramaswamy had backed the H-1B visa while also pointing out that the system was broken and needed reform.

According to Politico , Ramaswamy told close associates as recently as Saturday evening that he was actively working on DOGE, even saying he was busy drafting executive orders. However, someone familiar with the situation revealed that he had done little to no work on DOGE since early December.

(AFP) After more than a year hiding in tunnels and dodging air strikes, uniformed Hamas fighters returned to the ruined streets of Gaza hours into a ceasefire, defying Israel’s vow to crush them. With the world watching on Sunday as Hamas handed over three Israeli hostages to the Red Cross, dozens of balaclava-wearing fighters in the group’s signature green headbands were seen at the packed Gaza City square marshalling the chaotic events. related stories The day after, Hamas’s deputy interior minister for the territory was out and about in Gaza City, declaring that Gazans were “living in a moment of victory\". While Hamas was back on the streets, Israeli forces were withdrawing from the territory’s densely populated areas. The destruction they left behind was staggering, yet Hamas appears to have survived, in spite of Israel’s stated objective from the outset of the war of eradicating the group once and for all. “When you set yourself complete elimination (as a goal), if there is one man standing it can be regarded as failure,\" said Yossi Mekelberg, a Middle East expert at Chatham House. Hamas Experienced ‘Fiercest Bombardment’, Still Recruiting This could prove a problem for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who pledged in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel to destroy the group. “They were under the fiercest bombardment that such an organisation could ever sustain and they are still there and they are still recruiting,\" Mekelberg said. Israel decimated Hamas’s ranks and killed many of its top leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh and his successor Yahya Sinwar. On Tuesday, Israel’s army chief said its campaign had killed “nearly 20,000 Hamas operatives\". Mekelberg cautioned that it was too early to assess Hamas’s overall condition, and acknowledged it had suffered heavy losses, but “on your TV, you see that they are still there, with their bandanas and all their masks\". Muhammad Shehada, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel had specifically targeted civil servants, police and ministers, as part of its efforts to dismantle Hamas’s governing ability. “The continued presence of these officials and forces represents a symbol of defiance, showing they remain operational despite the onslaught,\" he said. On Monday, Hamas presented itself as triumphant for having survived, saying in a statement that “Gaza, with its great people and its resilience, will rise again to rebuild what the occupation has destroyed and continue on the path of steadfastness until the occupation is defeated\". Israel Stuck In Game Of ‘Whack-A-Mole’ The ceasefire is in its infancy and many questions remain about the future of the Gaza Strip and Hamas. Michael Horowitz, a Middle East analyst at the security consultancy Le Beck, said Hamas had made a show of strength both to deter rivals within the Palestinian ranks and to show Israel “that any additional rounds of fighting won’t lead anywhere\". That Hamas was not defeated was down to “one key reason\", he said, namely that Israel “hasn’t tried to replace Hamas as a governing entity in Gaza\". Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority have no role in the Gaza Strip. This “solely security-focused\" vision, said Horowitz, meant “Israel has been stuck in a game of whack-a-mole\". Eva Koulouriotis, an independent Middle East analyst, said Hamas retained “overwhelming popularity\" in Gaza, while “attempts… to provide a popular base for the Palestinian Authority and to reject Hamas’s rule have failed\". The destruction brought by the war did breed resentment towards Hamas among Gazans, said Shehada, but many were conflicted. People “also feel a sense of pride\" that Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, defied Israel’s might, he noted. “It revolves around the fact that people have been humiliated… And then it brings a source of pride\". The humanitarian cost of the war for the people of Gaza has been immense. The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory has put the death toll at more than 47,100, the majority civilians, figures the UN considers reliable. That devastation was in retaliation for Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures. Horowitz said the scale of destruction was among the worst of any urban battle in recent memory, adding it eclipsed the damage done to Mosul in Iraq during the campaign to dislodge the Islamic State group. top videos View all Swipe Left ...",

In a press briefing, Jaishankar said, “In terms of the irregular migration, we had a discussion on a range of issues and one of the issues which came up was mobility of people. We have a principled position on mobility that applies to all countries – as a government, we are very much supportive of legal mobility. We do believe in a global workspace. We want Indian talent and skills to have the maximum opportunity at a global level.\" “At the same time, we are very firmly opposed to illegal mobility and migration because when something illegal happens, many other illegal activities get joined into it.

Sources told Bloomberg that the Indian government was collaborating with the US authorities to identify undocumented Indian immigrants for deportation after the Trump administration began work on illegal immigration by mobilising troops along the US-Mexico border. According to the Pew Research Center, there are an estimated 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, making them the third largest group after those from Mexico and El Salvador.

The Indian government is also looking to protect the status of the H-1B visa for skilled migrants to the US, as 75% of the H-1B visas are given to Indian employees.

(IMAGE: REUTERS) Prince Harry claimed a “monumental\" victory over Rupert Murdoch’s UK newspaper group on Wednesday after the publisher settled his lawsuit, admitting unlawful actions at its Sun tabloid for the first time and paying substantial damages. Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles, had been suing News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, at the High Court in London, alleging the papers had illegally obtained private information about him from 1996 till 2011. related stories NGN also admitted it had intruded into the private life of Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana. A source familiar with the settlement said the damages involved an eight-figure sum. “In a monumental victory today, News UK have admitted that The Sun, the flagship title for Rupert Murdoch’s UK media empire, has indeed engaged in illegal practices,\" Harry and his co-claimant Tom Watson said in a statement. “Today the lies are laid bare. Today, the cover-ups are exposed. And today proves that no one stands above the law. The time for accountability has arrived,\" said the statement, read by their lawyer David Sherborne outside the High Court. The trial to consider Harry’s case, and a similar lawsuit from former senior British lawmaker Watson, had been due to start on Tuesday but following last-gasp talks, the two sides reached a settlement, with NGN saying there had been wrongdoing at The Sun, something it had denied for years. “NGN offers a full and unequivocal apology to the Duke of Sussex for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun,\" Sherborne told the court. “NGN further apologises to the Duke for the impact on him of the extensive coverage and serious intrusion into his private life as well as the private life of Diana, Princess of Wales, his late mother, in particular during his younger years.\" It also admitted targeting Watson, including when he was a junior minister under then prime minister Gordon Brown, who had been due to give evidence if the trial had gone ahead. ‘STRONG CONTROLS’ In a statement, an NGN spokesperson said its apology was for the unlawful actions of private investigators working for The Sun, not of its journalists. “There are strong controls and processes in place at all our titles today to ensure this cannot happen now. There was no voicemail interception on The Sun,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the settlement marked the likely end of any lawsuits, and that future cases were liable to be thrown out. NGN has paid out hundreds of millions of pounds to victims of phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering by the News of the World, and settled more than 1,300 lawsuits involving celebrities, politicians, well-known sports figures and ordinary people who were connected to them or major events. In their joint statement, Harry and Watson said NGN had now paid out more than 1 billion pounds. NGN previously always rejected any claims that there was wrongdoing at The Sun newspaper, or that any senior figures knew about it or tried to cover it up, as Harry’s lawsuit alleges. Harry said his mission was to establish the truth and for the publishers’ executives and editors to be held to account, after other claimants settled cases to avoid the risk of a multi-million pound legal bill that could be imposed even if they had won in court but had rejected NGN’s offer. Harry’s main target had been Rebekah Brooks, who was editor of The Sun for part of the period when NGN has admitted there was unlawful behaviour and is now the chief executive of News UK, News Corp’s British arm. “They now admit, when she was editor of The Sun, they ran a criminal enterprise,\" Harry and Watson’s statement said, adding they wanted the police and parliament to investigate “the perjury and cover-ups\". However, NGN’s apology made no direct reference to any wrongdoing by its senior figures, nor to the allegation that there had been any cover-ups by current or former executives. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all London police said it had no active investigation ongoing. “We await any correspondence from the parties involved, which we will respond to in due course,\" a spokesman said.

        "summary": "On 21 January 2025, a coalition of 22 Democratic-leaning states, led by California and New York, filed lawsuits against US President Donald Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The order, signed on 20 January, reinterprets the 14th Amendment to deny citizenship to individuals born in the US if their mother was unlawfully present or on a temporary visa and their father was not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident. Critics, including legal experts and civil rights groups, argue the order is unconstitutional as the amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born on US soil. California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the action \"un-American\" and vowed to challenge it in court. Separately, Trump revoked protections for \"sensitive areas\" like schools and hospitals during immigration enforcement operations, raising fears of mass deportations. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called for calm while preparing to handle the impact of Trump’s policies. n18oc_world n18oc_crux",

(AP) India’s advanced health systems may cushion the impact of the United States’ decision to exit the World Health Organization (WHO), but it may derail crucial initiatives in vulnerable regions, multiple public health experts told News18. The move was expected in 2020 as US President Donald Trump had already initiated steps to withdraw from WHO, citing the health agency’s biases towards China. However, it was subsequently reversed by new President Joe Biden in January 2021. related stories According to Dr K Srinath Reddy, the US withdrawal is extremely “unfortunate\". “In an era where multilateral cooperation is essential for collectively addressing major global health challenges that arise from pandemic threats, climate change catalysed assaults on human health and antimicrobial resistance, USA’s withdrawal from WHO is extremely unfortunate,\" he said. Reddy believes that in an interconnected and interdependent world, it will have adverse consequences not only for other countries but also for the US. Another public health expert, Rajib Dasgupta, professor and chairperson, Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University, believes that health agenda-setting is now global, as interconnectedness through travel, trade, and technology spreads health challenges across borders. He calls for the need for international collaboration to address shared health issues effectively. “Agenda setting in health has increasingly become global and the connectedness of people across politico-administrative boundaries cannot be overemphasised.\" However, the move may not impact India harshly. Dr Anurag Agrawal, dean, biosciences and health research, Ashoka University, told News18 that the move does not mean much for India since “we are past the point where WHO support was essential for our health systems, but it may be a challenge elsewhere in the world where there is dependence on international support via WHO\". Possibility Of U-Turn? Trump has authorised a withdrawal from the WHO as well as a cessation of negotiations over a pandemic treaty. These events were anticipated by the global health community and there is a one-year transition time. “It is possible that the current administration could be persuaded to reconsider and instead cut their contributions to the WHO,\" Lakshmy Ramakrishnan, associate fellow at think tank Observer Research Foundation said. Right now, Ramakrishnan believes the rest of the global community needs to understand how to navigate the path ahead and ask some “hard questions\". “For instance: What will be the impact on activities like global infectious disease surveillance networks? And is it time to go back to the drawing board over the negotiations of the pandemic treaty,\" she said. Ramakrishnan believes that the decision has serious implications for global health security, but the Covid-19 pandemic showed us that transparency and responsible science communication are also essential. Bad News For Weaker Countries The US exit may not impact India majorly, but it will definitely impact smaller and underdeveloped nations. The US contributes about 18-19 per cent of the funding to WHO. Therefore, its decision to pull out can lead to a financial crunch, which could adversely affect various health-related programmes. Reading the scenario, Dr Agrawal — who is also ex-director of CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology — believes that “unless the Trump administration creates a viable alternate path to support global health, this is effectively a decision that undercuts support for valuable programs in low income nations, at a time when we should have learnt that one cannot hide from global pandemic threats\". Meanwhile, as WHO will lose its top funder, other countries will need to step up their contributions and increase the level of scientific collaboration amongst themselves. “Both international cooperation and self-reliance will now acquire new purpose and fresh forms of functioning,\" Dr Reddy pointed out. These could include measures to control/treat HIV-AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases. Lack of funding could also result in halting some research projects. “The US pulling out of WHO may not be much of a negative to the US itself, however, it could have a major impact on African and Asian nations.

(Courtesy: Reuters) A fire raged through a 12-story hotel at a popular ski resort in northwestern Turkey early Tuesday during a school holiday, killing at least 76 people — at least two of them when they jumped from the building to escape the flames, officials said. At least 51 people also were injured in the fire at the Grand Kartal hotel in Kartalkaya, in Bolu province’s Koroglu mountains, some 300 kilometres (185 miles) east of Istanbul, said Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya. The fire occurred near the start of a two-week winter break for schools when hotels in the region are packed. related stories “Our hearts are broken. We are in mourning, “ Yerlikaya told reporters outside the hotel. \"But you should know that whoever is responsible for causing this pain will not escape justice.\" Atakan Yelkovan, a hotel guest staying on the third floor, told the IHA news agency there was chaos on the upper floors as other guests tried to escape, including by trying to climb down from their rooms using sheets and blankets. “People on the upper floors were screaming. They hung down sheets … Some tried to jump,\" Yelkovan said. Yerlikaya said 45 of the 76 people killed have been identified while efforts to identify the other victims were continuing. “Forty-five bodies were delivered to their families. We could not (immediately) identify the others,\" Yerlikaya said, adding that the emergency response teams would conduct a final search for victims on Wednesday. Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu said at least one of the injured was in serious condition, while 17 other people were treated and released. The hotel had 238 registered guests, Yerlikaya said. The fire was reported at 3:27 a.m. and the fire department began to respond at 4:15 a.m., he told reporters. The government appointed six prosecutors to lead an investigation into the blaze, which is believed to have started in the hotel’s restaurant section. Nine people have been detained as part of the investigation into the fire, Yerlikaya said. Earlier, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said the hotel’s owner was among the people detained for questioning in the probe. At least two of the victims died when they jumped from the building in panic, Gov. Abdulaziz Aydin told the state-run Anadolu Agency earlier. Those killed included Nedim Turkmen, a columnist for Sozcu newspaper, his wife and two children, the newspaper announced. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a day of national mourning to be observed on Wednesday. All flags at government buildings and Turkish diplomatic mission abroad would be lowered to half-staff, he said. Necmi Kepcetutan, a ski instructor at the hotel, said he was asleep when the fire erupted and he rushed out of the building. He told NTV television that he then helped some 20 guests out of the hotel. The hotel was engulfed in smoke, making it difficult for guests to locate the fire escape, he said. “I cannot reach some of my students. I hope they are OK,\" the ski instructor told the station. Television images showed the roof and top floors of the hotel on fire. Witnesses and reports suggested that the hotel’s fire detection system failed to operate. “My wife smelled the burning. The alarm did not go off,\" said Yelkovan, the guest interviewed by IHA. “We tried to go upstairs but couldn’t, there were flames. We went downstairs and came here (outside),\" he said. Yelkovan said it took about an hour for the firefighting teams to arrive. NTV television suggested that the wooden cladding on the exterior of the hotel, in a chalet-style design, may have accelerated the spread of the fire. Part of the 161-room hotel is on the side of a cliff, hampering efforts to combat the flames. “Because the rear side is on a slope, intervention could only be made from the front and sides,\" Yerlikaya confirmed. Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy told reporters that the hotel underwent inspections in 2021 and 2024 and that “no negative situation regarding fire competence\" was reported by the fire department. Earlier, in an address in Ankara, Erdogan said: “Unfortunately, we received very sad news this morning from Bolu, Kartalkaya. Our brothers and sisters were killed and injured in a fire that broke out in a hotel.\" “All necessary steps will be taken to shed light on all aspects of the incident and to hold those responsible accountable,\" he added. NTV showed a smoke-blackened lobby, its glass entrance and windows smashed, its wooden reception desk charred and a chandelier crashed to the ground.

(IMAGE: AP PHOTO) President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The new entity, Stargate, will start building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum. related stories “It’s big money and high quality people,\" said Trump, adding that it’s “a resounding declaration of confidence in America’s potential\" under his new administration. Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has already started and the project goes back to 2024. “This will be the most important project of this era,\" said Altman, CEO of OpenAI. Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine. “This is the beginning of golden age,\" said Son, referencing Trump’s statement that the US would be in a “golden age\" with him back in the White House. Son, a billionaire based in Japan, already committed in December to invest $100 billion in US projects over the next four years. He previously committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump’s first term, which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company WeWork. While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented. The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers. OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration’s Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects “can be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.\" Other partners in the project include Microsoft, investor MGX and the chipmakers Arm and NVIDIA, according to separate statements by Oracle and OpenAI. The push to build data centers predates Trump’s presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally. Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChatGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks. The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI’s expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses. Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology’s possible risks to national security and economic well-being.

(Reuters) Pakistan has agreed terms for a $1 billion loan with two Middle Eastern banks at a 6%-7% interest rate, its Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told Reuters on Tuesday, as the South Asian country looks for more financing. “With two institutions we have now gone forward in signing up the term sheet – one bilateral and one for trade (finance),\" Aurangzeb said during an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos. related stories The loans were short-term, or up to one year, Aurangzeb added. The country’s central bank chief told Reuters in August that Pakistan aimed to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year. Aurangzeb added that Pakistan was aiming to discuss with ratings agencies a move towards a single B rating, and hoping to see an upgrade in the months to come. “Ideally I would like to think that some action in this direction can take place before our fiscal year is over, which is this June,\" he said. Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s ratings to ‘Caa2’ in August, citing improving macroeconomic conditions, and Fitch raised its rating to CCC+ in July following the IMF staff level agreement. However, both these ratings are still deep in sub-investment grade – or “junk\" – territory. IMF HOPES Pakistan aims to boost its finances after securing a $7 billion International Monetary Fund bailout in September 2024, with the first review set for late February. “We have the first formal review of the EFF coming through towards (the) end of February,\" Aurangzeb said. “I do think we are in good stead for that review.\" IMF extended fund facilities (EFFs) provide financial assistance to countries facing serious medium-term balance of payments problems resulting from structural weaknesses that require time to address. In October, Aurangzeb said Islamabad had made a formal request for around $1 billion in funding from the IMF via its Resilience and Sustainability Trust. The RST, created in 2022, provides long-term concessional cash for climate-related spending, such as adaptation and transitioning to cleaner energy. Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. Aurangzeb said Islamabad will take discussions forward on RST financing when the IMF mission visits for the first review of the EFF programme. “I’m hoping in the next sort of six to nine months, we can get there with the Fund as well,\" said Aurangzeb.

Published By : News Desk Associated Press Last Updated: January 21, 2025, 23:50 IST Netanyahu, who was prime minister for all but one of the 14 years leading up to the attack, has not taken responsibility. reset Follow us on Google News Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu (AP Image) Israel’s top general on Tuesday became the highest-ranking official to resign over Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, the worst security failure in the country’s history. Like much of Israel’s top brass, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi remained in his post through the 15-month war in the Gaza Strip, the related conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon and tensions with Iran that led the two countries to exchange fire twice last year. related stories But days into a ceasefire with Hamas, and with the other conflicts having wound down, he and the head of Israel’s Southern Command, which oversees operations in Gaza, announced they would step down. Their resignations are likely to fuel longstanding calls in Israel for a public inquiry into the security and intelligence failures of Oct. 7. That could implicate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has insisted that such an investigation can only be held after the war. Here’s a look at who has taken the fall for Oct. 7 and who hasn’t. Netanyahu, who was prime minister for all but one of the 14 years leading up to the attack, has not taken responsibility. He says he is among several officials who should face tough questions but that any public inquiry must wait until the end of the war. His critics say he bears responsibility, not only for the failure to prevent the attack, but for his longstanding policy of trying to contain Hamas in Gaza. That included allowing Qatar to deliver large amounts of financial aid — some of it in suitcases of cash — to the territory in exchange for calm. Netanyahu has sought to reframe his legacy during the war, boasting of unprecedented achievements against Iran and its militant allies across the region. He has vowed to keep fighting until all the hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 attack are returned and Hamas has been dismantled. Netanyahu fired his popular defense minister in November, citing differences over the conduct of the war and replacing him with a loyalist. Gallant — who has long called for a public inquiry into the Oct. 7 failures — emerged as one of Israel’s more popular leaders during the war, in part by prioritizing a hostage deal over the annihilation of Hamas in the last months of his tenure. In announcing his resignation, Halevi acknowledged his responsibility for the military’s failure on Oct. 7 and said he would ensure its internal investigations into the attack would be completed before leaving his role on March 6. Bar has led the agency, which is tasked with collecting intelligence on Palestinians, since 2021. He took responsibility for the failure to thwart the attack just days after it occurred but has not resigned, saying investigations into what happened would need to come after the war. Barnea would likely bear less responsibility for the Oct. 7 failures, as the Mossad is tasked with spying on enemies outside the territories Israel controls. He was a leading negotiator in more than a year of indirect talks with Hamas that led to this month’s ceasefire. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all In his letter of resignation, Finkelman said his failure to defend southern Israel on Oct. 7 “will be etched into me for the rest of my life.\" Haliva resigned in April, saying his directorate had not lived up to its mission on Oct. 7. “I carry that black day with me ever since, day after day, night after night.

Trump, who took office on Monday, set off alarm bells in early January by refusing to rule out military intervention to bring the Panama Canal and Greenland under US control. related stories While Trump didn’t mention Greenland in his inauguration speech on Monday, he was asked about it by reporters in the Oval Office afterwards. “Greenland is a wonderful place, we need it for international security,\" Trump responded. “I’m sure that Denmark will come along — it’s costing them a lot of money to maintain it, to keep it,\" he added. But Greenlandic and Danish officials on Tuesday defended the Arctic island’s right to self-determination. “We are Greenlanders. We don’t want to be Americans. We don’t want to be Danish either. Greenland’s future will be decided by Greenland,\" Prime Minister Mute Egede told a press conference. “Our country and our people will decide what happens to Greenland,\" he said. Noting that the country was facing a “difficult situation\", Egede reiterated that Nuuk was open to talks with Washington to safeguard US interests in the Arctic, at a time when rivalries with China and Russia in the region are growing. The United States has an active military base in the northwest of Greenland, which has a strategic location in the Arctic as ice melts due to climate change and opens up new shipping lanes. The world’s largest island — whose capital Nuuk is closer to New York than Copenhagen — also holds massive untapped mineral and oil reserves, although oil and uranium exploration are banned. “We have cooperated with the US on security issues for more than 80 years,\" Egede recalled. He said officials were working to organise a meeting with the US “to explain Greenland’s position\". ‘Can’t just help themselves’ Egede acknowledged that Trump’s recent remarks were “worrying\" and had caused concern among Greenlanders. “But it is important to remain calm.\" Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said earlier Tuesday that no country should be able to simply help themselves to another country. “Of course we can’t have a world order where countries, if they’re big enough, no matter what they’re called, can just help themselves to what they want,\" Lokke told reporters. Greenland is scheduled to call elections before April 6, where the question of independence is expected to top the agenda. Economically, Greenland depends on subsidies from Copenhagen equivalent to a fifth of its GDP, and on its fishing sector. Despite its autonomy, Copenhagen is in charge of judicial affairs, monetary policy, foreign affairs, defence and security policy in Greenland. On Monday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a post to Instagram that Europe would need to “navigate a new reality\" with Trump as president. While noting the Greenlandic people’s right to self-determination, the head of government also stressed the need for Denmark to maintain its alliance with the US — which she described as Denmark’s most important since World War II. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all A number of Danish party leaders were called to the prime minister’s office on Tuesday to be briefed on the situation. “We have to recognise that the next four years will be difficult years,\" Pia Olsen Dyhr, leader of the Green Left, told reporters after meeting with Frederiksen. tags : donald trump Greenland Location : Copenhagen, Denmark First Published: January 21, 2025, 23:08 IST News world 'We Don't Want To Be Americans': Greenland PM To Trump Read More",

(IMAGE: X) A lawsuit challenging the Executive Order (EO) signed by President Donald Trump revoking birthright citizenship was filed in a court in the US state of New Hampshire, according to the Times of India . One of the plaintiffs is Aarti Kohli, the executive director of the Asian Law Caucus (ALC). related stories Kohli had earlier, in a statement released by the ALC shortly after Trump’s inauguration, said the US President “has vowed to dismantle our constitutional rights\" and that there is an “aggressive, extremist campaign against immigrants, refugees, working people, union members, LGBTQ+ communities, and people of color\". Automatic US citizenship to people born in the country is enshrined in the Constitution and news agencies had said that Trump’s action is certain to face a legal challenge. Immigrants’ rights advocates including the American Civil Liberties Union, Asian Law Caucus, State Democracy Defenders Fund, and others are those challenging the EO. They filed a lawsuit against the EO in a US district court (District of New Hampshire). The lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of ignoring the Constitution, congressional intent, and long-established Supreme Court rulings. The plaintiffs argue that birthright citizenship is the principle that every baby born in the US automatically becomes an American citizen. The 14th Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees citizenship to all children born in the US, except for children of foreign diplomats. It states, “All persons born or naturalized in the US, and ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ thereof, are citizens of the US and the state where they live.\" The Trump EO mandates that one of the parents has to be a US citizen or green card holder at the time of the child’s birth and says that the child’s is ineligible for birthright citizenship when the mother is either ‘unlawfully present’ in the US, and the father is not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident (green card holder) at the time of the child’s birth, or when the mother is ‘lawfully but temporarily in the US’ (on a visa), and the father is neither a US citizen nor a green card holder at the time of the child’s birth. “If you’re born here, you are a citizen — period. No politician, including President Trump, can decide who is American and who is not,\" Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus (ALC), was quoted as saying by Times of India . “This order seeks to repeat one of the gravest errors in American history, by creating a permanent subclass of people born in the US who are denied full rights as Americans,\" Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told Times of India . Trump acknowledged the inevitability that the move to reverse a right enshrined in the US Constitution will face stiff legal challenges. “I think we have good grounds, but you could be right,\" he said when asked about the pushback. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said the 14th Amendment was “crystal clear\" in granting citizenship to anyone born in the United States with the exception of children of foreign diplomats. “We have had birthright citizenship for centuries, and a president cannot take it away with an executive order,\" he told news agency AFP . “We expect rapid court challenges\". tags : donald trump US Citizenship Location : Washington D.C., United States of America (USA) First Published: January 21, 2025, 22:14 IST News world Indian American-Led Group Among Those Suing Trump Admin Over Order Ending Birthright Citizenship Read More",

Israel announced a “significant and broad military operation\" against Palestinian militants in the city. Jenin has seen repeated Israeli incursions and gunbattles with militants in recent years, even before Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack ignited the war in Gaza. related stories The latest operation came just days into a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza that is supposed to last for six weeks and see 33 militant-held hostages released in return for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Three hostages and 90 prisoners were released on Sunday, when it took effect. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek an independent state encompassing all three territories. The ceasefire does not apply to the West Bank, which has seen a surge of violence since the start of the war. Israeli troops have carried out near-daily raids that often ignite gunbattles. There has also been a rise in attacks on Palestinians by Jewish extremists — including a rampage in two Palestinian villages overnight Monday — as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis. Hamas condemned the Israeli operation in Jenin, calling on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to step up their own attacks. The smaller and more radical Islamic Jihad militant group also condemned the operation, saying it reflected Israel’s “failure to achieve its goals in Gaza.\" It said it was also a “desperate attempt\" by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to save his governing coalition. Netanyahu has faced criticism from his far-right allies over the ceasefire, which required Israeli troops to pull back from populated areas in Gaza and envisions the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including militants convicted of involvement in deadly attacks on Israelis. The ceasefire has already seen Hamas return to the streets, showing that it remains in firm control of the territory despite 15 months of war that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread devastation. One of his erstwhile partners, Itamar Ben-Gvir, quit the government the day the ceasefire went into effect, weakening the coalition but still leaving Netanyahu with a parliamentary majority. Another, far-right leader, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to bolt if Israel does not resume the war after the first phase of the ceasefire ends in six weeks. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. More than 90 captives are still being held in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities but do not say how many of the dead were fighters.

Kudos to the director duo, who seamlessly blend in their individual instincts and style, never once making you wonder that there are two captains sailing the ship! The film is bereft of melodramatic dialogues about desh bhakti or contrived sequences aimed to evoke sappy sentimentality. The makers manage to strike a fine balance between realism and cinematic flamboyance and they deserve brownie points for the same.\" “One of the major highlights of Sky Force is its breathtaking aerial combat sequences packed with edge-of-the-seat thrill. They may remind you of Fighter but unlike the Hrithik Roshan starrer, this one isn’t amply slick, cool and stylish, but that works with the template and mood of the film. These scenes are punctuated with moments that accentuate the valour and sacrifices made by fighter pilots,\" the review also mentioned. tags : Akshay Kumar bollywood veer pahariya Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 26, 2025, 11:36 IST News movies Sky Force Box Office: Akshay Kumar's Film Earns Rs 33.75 Crore in 2 Days Read More",

Twinkle Khanna recently wrote an article for a newspaper, in which she wrote about ‘missus blaming’. She cited several examples, and pointed out how the women (especially wives) are blamed in every situation or problem that men face. She highlighted how Anushka Sharma is blamed when Virat Koli gets out. She also shared a recent example wherein ‘ridiculous’ rumours surfaced about Kareena Kapoor Khan after her husband Saif Ali Khan was stabbed by an intruder in their residence. In her column for Times Of India, Twinkle Khanna wrote that she double-checks the window locks before going to bed, and that a sense of vulnerability has taken root in homes everywhere, in the wake of Saif Ali Khan’s stabbing. Further slamming the rumours involving Kareena Kapoor Khan, Twinkle wrote, “While Saif was in hospital, ridiculous rumours swirled that his wife hadn’t been at home or had been too intoxicated to help him during the assault. The absence of any sort of evidence did nothing to stop these dumb theories. People just enjoyed shifting the blame onto the wife — an all-too-familiar pattern.\" related stories View this post on Instagram A post shared by Twinkle Khanna (@twinklerkhanna) Twinkle Khanna Points Out Anushka Sharma Gets Blamed Whenever Virat Kohli Gets Out She further shared instances wherein the blame is unfairly shifted on wives. She pointed out that when the Beatles spilt, people blamed John Lennon’s wife Yoko Ono. “When Virat Kohli gets out, then Anushka gets booed. When Beckham could not bend it on the football field, fingers were pointed at Victoria,\" she wrote. She said that the wife-blaming is not just restricted to couples in the public eye. In the same column, Twinkle Khanna wrote that during an interview, she was asked what it’s like being a ‘star wife’. “While my first instinct is to bite the reporter’s index finger, I reply, ‘I am not sure that an entity like ‘star wife’ exists, unless, in the way that Manglik women marry trees, because of some Rahu Ketu ka dosh, you end up marrying Sirius or worse, Halley’s Comet’,\" she wrote. She further added that she is also often asked about, and blamed for, the difference in political views between her and her husband Akshay Kumar. “It’s almost like people believe he isn’t my husband but a toddler who will listen to me when I say, ‘Beta ji, please walk on the left side of the road, and I will give you a Frooti,’\" she wrote.

Musicians who have been bestowed this honour include Arijit Singh, Jaspinder Narula and Ricky Kej, along with veteran actor Ashok Saraf and veteran theatre director Barry John.

My dad was behind all this. He would help me with my riyaaz. He taught me what it means to work hard. I would tell him to not leave me because I’ve a lot left to achieve and he needs to see all of it. But unfortunately, four years ago, he left us.\" Narula’s career as a singer in films began after late music director Kalyanji of Kalyanji-Anandji fame heard her at a private gathering in Delhi and asked his son and music director, Viju Shah, to give her a break.

Speculations had been running wild ever since director Ram Gopal Varma announced his upcoming project Syndicate, with reports linking Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan and acclaimed actors Fahadh Faasil and Manoj Bajpayee to key roles. However, RGV has now stepped forward to dismiss these rumors, putting to rest the swirling buzz around the film’s cast. A report from Telugu 360 previously suggested that Syndicate would feature an ensemble cast bridging Bollywood and the South Indian film industry. It claimed that Amitabh Bachchan was slated for an extended cameo, while Tollywood actor Venkatesh Daggubati was in talks for a lead role with a 35-day shoot schedule. Additionally, Fahadh Faasil, Manoj Bajpayee, and Anurag Kashyap were reportedly being approached for pivotal roles. The report also speculated that the film would commence production in mid-February. related stories On Saturday, Ram Gopal Varma took to X (formerly Twitter) to quash these rumors. “There are all kinds of speculations going around the casting of Syndicate, which are all completely FALSE.

Sharing insights about the film’s concept on X, he emphasized that while street gangs were once seen as a significant threat, the real danger today stems from the emergence of powerful syndicates. These groups, he explained, comprise a sinister nexus of political factions, law enforcement, ultra-wealthy business magnates, and even military operatives. The director also highlighted how today’s intense polarization in the country creates fertile ground for such an ominous syndicate to rise. Unlike a supernatural horror film, RGV described Syndicate as a terrifying exploration of human nature’s darkest truths and the cyclical nature of crime and terror. “Crime and terror never die; they keep coming back in deadlier forms,\" he remarked, shedding light on the chilling themes of the film. In a bold statement, RGV vowed to redeem his cinematic legacy with Syndicate. “I took a VOW to WASH AWAY all my CINEMA SINS that I committed over the PAST FEW YEARS with this JUST one SINGLE film called SYNDICATE,\" he wrote. Promising an intense and realistic narrative, he assured audiences that Syndicate would be a film that horrifies not with the supernatural, but with its unflinching portrayal of humanity’s potential for darkness. tags : amitabh bachchan bollywood fahadh faasil Ram Gopal Varma regional cinema Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 20:49 IST News movies Ram Gopal Varma Shuts Down Rumors About Amitabh Bachchan, Fahadh Faasil In Syndicate Read More",

But I think it’s time for a moment of self-reflection as to ‘are you doing the right thing for yourself, your family?’ I think it’s time for us to value life a little more than we do.\" When asked about the common notion about women being bad drivers, Samantha initially expressed surprise, saying, “Is that a thing, really? I hear it but I really haven’t seen the proof of it.\" She then countered the stereotype by highlighting that women are great at multi-tasking, which actually makes them better drivers! related stories “Women are great ta multi-tasking so they are probably very good at focusing on the road as well,\" she said. Check out the video below! View this post on Instagram A post shared by News18.com (@cnnnews18) She was then asked whether she drives, to which she replied, “Not well. So, I choose not to.\" When asked what irks her the most about road safety, she mentioned that cutting lanes and excessive honking are the most frustrating. “Definitely cutting lanes and honking. I don’t see that in any other country. Not so much as I see it here. I think that road etiquette is something that…just because you can drive, I don’t think you should be on the road. You should also have a certain amount of driver etiquette,\" she said. tags : regional cinema Sadak Suraksha Abhiyan Samantha Ruth Prabhu Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 19:14 IST News movies Samantha Ruth Prabu Reacts To Female Driver Stereotype, ‘Women Are Great At Multi-Tasking’ | VIDEO Read More",

The post was shared on Reddit (now deleted) with the caption, “Pauline Chalamet on billionaires; meanwhile, her brother is dating one.\" Social media users instantly chimed in with divided reactions. While some wondered if her post was directed at his brother’s girlfriend, others argued that she could have her own opinion. A user wrote, “We underestimate people’s cognitive dissonance, because yeah, she’s criticising billionaires, but nothing implies she’s targeting Kylie as well,\" while another added, “I mean, she’s not responsible for who her brother dates; it’s not like she can break up with Kylie.\" “If we’re all going to be judged by our relatives’ significant others or their political views, then not a single one of us is safe lol,\" another comment read.

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Sandra Bullock, the beloved Hollywood icon, has found herself in the middle of a heated legal dispute involving Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni . This has reportedly happened because of an unearthed post from months ago, sparking a bizarre twist in an already complicated saga. The drama started brewing just before Christmas when Blake Lively, 37, accused Baldoni, 40, of sexual harassment, kicking off a legal battle that quickly turned messy. To add fuel to the fire, The New York Times released an article based on Lively’s legal filings, which not only detailed her allegations but also claimed Baldoni had orchestrated a smear campaign against her. Not one to back down, Baldoni responded by suing The New York Times for defamation and filing a jaw-dropping $400 million lawsuit against Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds. He accused the Hollywood power couple of using their celebrity influence to sabotage his career and hijack his project. related stories So, where does Sandra Bullock fit into all of this? Flashback to July 2023: filming for It Ends With Us had just wrapped and Reynolds took to social media to post a cheeky birthday tribute to his The Proposal co-star. “Happy Birthday to the inimitable and stunning Sandra Bullock! For your birthday this year, I got us both intimacy coordinators. And an HR department. And clothing?\" Reynolds had written. The post also included a clip from their infamous naked scene in the film. The actor’s fans now believe the caption held more meaning than what met the eye. At the time, it seemed like a typical Reynolds quip, but in light of Lively’s reported on-set demands, it feels almost prophetic. Check it out here: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) Social media lit up with reactions. One fan commented, “The caption makes sense now,\" while others pointed out Reynolds’ apparent jab at Baldoni through the caption. According to leaked details, Lively had insisted on an intimacy coordinator being present at all times during her scenes with Baldoni. Among her 30 reported demands were strict boundaries like no improvising during kissing scenes, no biting or lip-sucking without explicit consent and ensuring all intimate interactions were “in character,\" informs Daily Mail. The drama reached new heights when Baldoni’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, released a video exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com. The footage showed multiple takes of a dance scene between Lively and Baldoni, seemingly contradicting her claims of discomfort during filming. Lively, however, countered that the video only reinforced her unease, insisting it demonstrated the very behaviour she found objectionable. Meanwhile, she and Reynolds filed a legal motion requesting a gag order on Baldoni’s attorneys. In a court filing, the couple accused Freedman of running a “harassing and retaliatory media campaign\" against them. With every twist and turn, this legal battle has managed to rope in unexpected players like Sandra Bullock and ignite a media frenzy. As Lively and Reynolds push for a protective order, Baldoni’s team shows no signs of backing down. tags : entertainment Ryan Reynolds Sandra Bullock Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 18:34 IST News movies Why Sandra Bullock Has Been Dragged Into Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively And Justin Baldoni Saga Read More",

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Imagine coming home to find that a stranger has not only invaded your personal space but has made themselves remarkably comfortable, snacking in your kitchen, taking a shower and rummaging through your belongings. For Kid Cudi, this bizarre nightmare became a reality earlier this January when an intruder reportedly broke into his Los Angeles residence. The individual, described by the rapper as a “crazed fan,\" was eventually apprehended by L.A. County Sheriff’s deputies, but the experience left a mark on Cudi. What made matters worse was seeing people on social media making jokes about the situation. Taking to Instagram Stories and X on January 23, the Ohio-born artist addressed the incident and the hurtful jokes circulating online. He began by calling out the trolls and providing a clearer picture of the unsettling ordeal. related stories “I see the internet running with things and making jokes this s*** is not funny. The person who broke into my house was a crazed fan who had been stalking me for years without me knowing. He’s been to shows, events I’ve done in the States and overseas,\" he wrote. This wasn’t just an ordinary break-in. As Cudi explained, the man had gone to extreme lengths to get to him, driving across the country in hopes of sharing ideas and pitching collaborations. But what he did after breaking in crossed all boundaries of privacy. “He rummaged through personal things, my fiancee’s stuff, took a shower and ate, all while thinking he was gonna have a conversation with me. This was an unhinged 34-year-old man,\" Cudi shared. Adding to his frustration was the incorrect assumption by some online that the intruder was homeless. Cudi firmly shut down that speculation while emphasising how this violation of his privacy has made him rethink his safety measures moving forward. “There is nothing funny about this. My privacy was violated, and now I have to protect myself. I don’t feel safe now,\" he wrote. The Grammy-winning artist also warned that this experience may affect how he interacts with fans in public. “If I’m standoffish when you see me in public now, this is why,\" he admitted.

He further said that at that moment, Samuel L Jackson, the seasoned actor who played Calvin’s disturbingly loyal slave, Stephen, helped him. Known for his no-nonsense approach, Jackson didn’t sugarcoat his advice. As Foxx recalled, Jackson firmly told DiCaprio, “Get over it, mother******! It’s just another Tuesday, mother******!\" related stories Foxx himself also stepped in to help DiCaprio embrace the uncomfortable reality of his character. “I told Leo, ‘We are not friends. This is your property. These aren’t humans. This is your property,’\" Foxx explained. Taking the advice to heart, DiCaprio took his preparation to the next level. The next day, he reportedly arrived on set and stayed completely in character, refusing to engage with anyone outside of his role. Tarantino’s habit of incorporating racial slurs into his scripts has been a long-standing point of controversy. According to The Independent, films like Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight have drawn criticism for their liberal use of the N-word. However, Jackson, a frequent Tarantino collaborator, has often defended the director’s choices, arguing that they’re rooted in authenticity. Jackson doubled down on this sentiment in an interview with Esquire, calling out the backlash against Tarantino’s scripts. “You can’t just tell a writer he can’t talk, write the words, or put the words in the mouths of the people from their ethnicities, the way that they use their words. You cannot do that, because then it becomes an untruth; it’s not honest. It’s just not honest,\" Jackson reportedly argued. In the end, DiCaprio overcame his discomfort and delivered a chilling performance as Calvin Candie, one that remains etched in cinematic history. Thanks to the combined efforts of Foxx, Jackson and Tarantino, the film achieved a raw authenticity that sparked conversation and controversy in equal measure. tags : entertainment hollywood jamie foxx Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 17:56 IST News movies Jamie Foxx Opens Up About Leonardo DiCaprio’s Struggles On The Set Of Django Unchained Read More",

In this exclusive interview with News18 Showsha, Ruuh and Joh open up about their creative process, their father’s influence, and their plans to shape the future of music. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Reuel (@ruuhmusic) Here are the excerpts: How did you come up with the idea for Gumshudah? What inspired the melody and lyrics? The idea for Gumshudah started with  JOH working on the music and beat first. Once that foundation was set, we developed the lyrics and melody. We wanted to incorporate both English and Hindi, and that duality really shaped the concept of the song. It was a very free-flowing and immediate process—one of those moments where everything just clicks. In fact, we ended up writing and composing the entire piece in just a couple of hours, which is always a great sign. After that, we sent it over to Smithy, our lyricist, to refine the lyrics. And that’s how the idea and composition of Gumshudah came to life. You mentioned that Gumshudah was initially created just for yourselves. How did it transition into becoming a part of Mismatched Season 3? Yes, we originally wrote Gumshudah as a song we wanted to release ourselves because it had a completely fresh sound—something that doesn’t exist in India, especially in Hindi. We really wanted to push this new vibe out there. Then, by some twist of fate, someone happened to play it for the showrunners of Mismatched. They listened to it and absolutely loved it! In fact, they had gone through several songs before coming across Gumshudah and immediately asked if they could use it for the show. It was all so serendipitous! What’s even crazier is that they didn’t give us any brief or ask for a single change. The song was used exactly as it was, in its original form. The song blends modern rhythms with heartfelt lyrics. How did you approach achieving this balance during the composition process? We actually came up with the melody first, even before working on the beat. The beat we ended up writing to was incredibly exciting—fresh, new, and youthful. It had this vibrant, young energy that we wanted to capture. At the same time, we aimed to make the song’s entry feel deep and emotionally resonant, while still being relatable to a younger audience. That’s why we included words like ‘forever maybe,’ which evoke a unique mental space. But then, when the song kicks in, it’s something you can totally dance to, you know! So, I think ...",

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Taylor Swift’s fans were sent into an absolute frenzy Friday morning when they noticed something shocking: both her 2006 debut album and 2017’s Reputation had reportedly vanished from Spotify. As the news spread, Swifties immediately started speculating about the cause of the strange disappearance. Some fans jumped to the conclusion that the albums had been pulled to make way for the re-recorded versions of Taylor Swift (name of her debut album) and Reputation, both albums she’s hinted at releasing for some time now. Others, more sceptical, suggested that it was all just a technical glitch, a bug in the system causing the albums to temporarily disappear. One Swiftie posted on X (formerly Twitter), “There’s no Reputation or Debut stolen version on Spotify OMG What is happening? Everybody calm down.\" In the clip, they showed the currently empty Spotify page where the albums used to be listed. Another fan account joined in saying, “’Debut’ and ‘Reputation’ were REMOVED from Taylor Swift’s Spotify page!\" And just like that, the fan base exploded with theories, questions and concerns. related stories THERE’S NO REPUTATION OR DEBUT STOLEN VERSION ON SPOTIFY OMG WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING EVERYBODY CALM DOWN pic.twitter.com/IT0R5sbo4f — TAYLA (@Ponar15) January 24, 2025 ? | “Debut\" and “reputation\" were REMOVED from Taylor Swift’s Spotify page! pic.twitter.com/2Z9AXDoqol — Taylor Swift News (@blessedswifty) January 24, 2025 By the time news outlets picked up on the situation, Swift’s debut album had reportedly reappeared on her page, but Reputation remained absent. This latest mystery adds fuel to the ongoing saga of Taylor Swift’s efforts to regain ownership of her music. Following a heated dispute with Big Machine Records and former manager Scooter Braun, Swift took the step of re-recording several of her albums to reclaim her work. So far, she’s released Fearless (Taylor’s Version), Red (Taylor’s Version), Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) and 1989 (Taylor’s Version). Fans are eagerly waiting for the next in line. Given that Reputation is one of the last albums she hasn’t re-recorded yet, many fans believe that its mysterious removal could signal that the re-recorded version is finally on its way. It’s no secret that Swift has been teasing this release for months and some speculate that the announcement could come at the Grammy Awards next month, much like her surprise reveal of The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) album at last year’s ceremony, reports Page Six. In fact, Swift’s fashion choices during the 2024 Grammy red carpet sparked more Reputation speculation. Fans noted her dark, goth-punk-inspired outfit as a nod to her Reputation era, which she once described as her “goth-punk moment of female rage.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bookish Swifties Club💜 (@bookishswiftiesclub) While it’s unclear whether the re-recorded Reputation album is dropping soon, Swift’s trademark Easter Eggs or hidden clues dropped in her music and public appearances have only added to the excitement. Fans are holding onto hope that the Grammy Awards will bring the announcement they’ve all been waiting for, especially considering that Swift used the same stage last year to drop some major news about her projects. For now, Swifties will have to stay tuned and keep a watchful eye on her every move. Could this be the calm before the storm of Reputation (Taylor’s Version)?

View this post on Instagram A post shared by HARNOOR (@harnoorhere) Here are the excerpts: “Famous\" is such a heartfelt exploration of love and nostalgia. What inspired you to write this song, and how does it reflect your personal journey? I made this song back when I was in a relationship, my partner used to doubt me a lot so I decided to write this song to win her trust and let her know what I think about her. The song transitions from a Pop-R&B rhythm to a Lofi soundscape. How did you decide on this two-part structure, and what message are you trying to convey through it? I made this song in Mexico a few years back, Arsh had made that switch and it just went crazy. My composition was fitting really well on the beat. You’ve mentioned that ‘Famous’ captures the simplicity of past moments. Can you share a specific memory that influenced the song’s lyrics or emotions? A specific memory from the song lyrics are when she told me that she talks to the moon when she’s lonely and I’m with the stars. How was the experience of working with Arsh Heer, Shraban, Mike Tucci, and the creative team for this track? We never interfere with each other’s work, we know our parts in the song and we beleive everyone knows their part the best. The visualizer for ‘Famous’ offers a glimpse into your daily life. How important is it for you to bring authenticity into your visuals, and what do you want fans to take away from them? I beleive in honesty, the industry in the west don’t usually hide their flaws and people spend a lot of money just to show off the streets This song was initially going to be just an audio release but I personally wanted a visualizer, I met my friends Pj and tej in Toronto and they killed the visualizer and this is my daily routine whenever I’m not home this is what I do. With your recent venture into songwriting, starting with “Letter to My Ex,\" how has the transition been? How does writing your own lyrics shape your connection with your music? “Letter to my ex\" is the first song I have written in a single day so it’s pretty important to me and this song is also about my first ex, it’s all about connectivity, Shraban made the melody and everything just happened next i didn’t put much effort into it, it was like my mind and heart automatically aligned with the song and the song and the things I have been wanting to say finally came out Do you find songwriting more challenging or liberating compared to performing songs written by others? I don’t feel it’s challenging, I think it’s easier writing a song by yourself, composing and singing but when you make a song with multiple minds like “sicko mode\" for example with Travis & Drake that song has a lot of writers, so I feel if there’s more people on a song it’s gonna be better. Can we expect more self-written tracks in your upcoming EP? If so, how are you pushing your boundaries as a songwriter? 100%, in the ne...",

From the sleepy, soulful town of Warrandyte to the dazzling stage of the Mahindra Blues Festival 2025, The Teskey Brothers are bringing their unmistakable blend of nostalgia-drenched blues and soul to India—and they’re doing it with style. Formed in 2008 by brothers Josh and Sam Teskey, this Australian band has been rewriting the blues playbook, infusing it with their own heartfelt authenticity and a generous dash of Aussie charm. They’re not just making music; they’re creating an experience that lingers long after the last note fades. Their story begins on the banks of the Yarra River, where they first started busking for local crowds. With nothing more than raw talent, a love for Otis Redding and Ray Charles, and a knack for crafting melodies as smooth as the river itself, they quickly captured hearts. Drawing inspiration from their picturesque surroundings, their music flows with the same emotional current—both powerful and tranquil—that defines the best of the blues. related stories Their debut album, Half Mile Harvest, is proof of their love for old-school sound. Recorded in their home studio using analog equipment, it’s as warm and timeless as a vinyl record spinning on a turntable. The album propelled them from local gigs to global acclaim, proving that their dedication to authenticity was exactly what the world was waiting for. Their sophomore effort, Run Home Slow, solidified their standing, debuting at number 2 on the ARIA Charts and earning them a well-deserved spot as one of Australia’s most cherished musical exports. What makes The Teskey Brothers stand out is their unshakable commitment to staying true to their roots. In an age dominated by digital perfection, they’ve embraced the imperfections of analog gear and the spontaneity of live performance, resulting in music that feels honest, raw, and alive. Their grassroots approach to building their career—no label, no manager, just passion and perseverance—has fostered a deep bond with their fans and earned them multiple ARIA Awards. Now, the Mahindra Blues Festival 2025 is their next big stage, and they couldn’t be more excited. For The Teskey Brothers, it’s not just about playing music; it’s about celebrating the enduring spirit of the blues and connecting with new audiences across continents. Their performance promises to be a soulful journey, blending the vintage charm of the genre with a fresh, modern perspective. In this exclusive interview with News18 Showsha, Josh Teskey dives into the band’s evolution, their connection to the blues, and what it means to bring their Australian soul to the Mahindra Blues Festival. Get ready for a story as compelling as their sound—where resilience meets rhythm, and hope finds its harmony. View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Teskey Brothers (@theteskeybrothers) Here are the excerpts: The Mahindra Blues Festival celebrates both resilience and hope. How do these themes align with your musical philosophy? Josh Teskey: Blues music, rhythm and blues music, soul music—whatever you want to call it—is a music that’s always been with us. It’s always been here, as long as you can remember, people have been singing rhythm and blues. And it’s going to stay here too. It’s never been the most popular of all music, it’s never at the very top of the pop charts, but it’s always had its place and its support. It’s timeless. That’s why we love it and can’t wait to see how the people respond to it in India firsthand. Blues has universal appeal but distinct regional flavors. What excites you most about bringing your Australian take on blues to an Indian audience? Josh Teskey: The town of Warrandyte is situated on the banks of the Yarra River, a beautiful river that influences our music in many ways. There always seem to be river analogies creeping into our lyrics and songwriting. Also, the incredible mentors and musicians of the area, of course, have played a great influence on us. Growing up in Warrandyte, how did your environment and community shape your love for soul and blues music? Josh Teskey: Artists like these are what influenced me to sing at all. The raw emotion that resonates in these voices—there’s just nothing like it. We also love the production and sounds on these records; it’s a sound we’ve always tried to aim for. What do you remember about those early days busking and performing at local venues? Are there any standout moments that you look back on fondly? Josh Teskey: It was never...",

Get ready to meet the future of blues—and don’t be surprised if he leaves you tapping your feet and dreaming big. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Taj Farrant (@tajfarrant) Here are the excerpts: As one of the youngest artists at the Mahindra Blues Festival, how do you feel about sharing the stage with legends of the genre? I feel honoured! Especially knowing that Buddy Guy has played at this festival a few times before. Blues is often considered a medium of storytelling. What stories are you most excited to share through your music at this festival? One thing I get a lot is that I’m too young to know what the Blues is about, so I guess my main story is that you don’t have to be old to be able to sing or play the Blues. Blues, for me, is about feeling the music and conveying that feeling to the listeners. What does performing at a festival that celebrates the future of blues alongside its rich heritage mean to you personally? This is a huge deal; it means that Blues is still very much alive, even though it might not be as mainstream as it should be. You’ve credited an AC/DC concert as the spark that ignited your passion for the guitar. What was it about Angus Young’s performance that captivated you so deeply? This is a hard one; there’s not one particular answer. When I saw Angus come up through the stage, I just knew straight away that that was what I wanted to do. There was just something about watching Angus that made me want to play guitar from that moment. Your father learned to play the guitar to help you pursue your passion. How did that influence your journey as a musician? Definitely Dad’s taste in music! I remember listening to Thin Lizzy and asking Dad who the guitarist was, and that was when we went down the YouTube rabbit hole of watching Gary Moore! At just 15, your music has been described as seasoned and mature. How do you channel such depth and emotion into your playing at such a young age? I don’t know to be honest, I just play because I love playing. Your music fuses blues and rock with soulful expression. How do you approach blending these genres into a cohesive sound? This answer is going to sound crazy, but I listen to a lot of rap and R&B. Those two genres have a different way of phrasing, and that helps me blend blues and rock into the way I like to play it. Chapter One has received significant acclaim. Can you share the inspiration and creative journey behind the album? Thank you. Chapter One is, well, the start of my music career. Each song on the album is a small story about my journey and how we moved from Australia to the US, but each song was written in a way so that anybody could r...",

In the glittering world of fame and stardom, being in the spotlight often comes with its own challenges. Actor-filmmaker Rakesh Roshan recently shared a candid anecdote that underscores the flipside of being a public figure. Recalling a moment of confrontation that left him both furious and reflective, Rakesh credited veteran actor Jeetendra for teaching him a valuable lesson in navigating fame. During a conversation with Fever FM, Rakesh shared an incident involving a drunk man at a restaurant, revealing how Jeetendra’s composed demeanor diffused a potentially volatile situation. “Once Jeetendra and I were sitting at a restaurant. There was a drunk man sitting right in front of us. For some reason, he began to abuse us, taking our names. I was furious looking at this. I said Jeetendra, ‘Jeetu, I think we should speak to him.’ Jeetu said, ‘Let’s go. Let’s keep quiet. We don’t know him, he knows us. So we are soft targets.’ So, we walked away from there. That was the lesson I learnt from him.\" related stories Rakesh Roshan’s reflections on this encounter come as he takes center stage in The Roshans, a Netflix documentary chronicling his family’s illustrious legacy in Indian cinema. The four-episode series delves into the journey of the Roshans, starting with his father, the legendary music composer Roshan, and highlights the contributions of his brother Rajesh Roshan and son Hrithik Roshan. In the documentary, Rakesh candidly discussed his transition from acting to directing, admitting that his career as an actor didn’t yield the success he had hoped for. Turning to filmmaking proved to be a turning point, with hits like Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai launching Hrithik Roshan’s career and the Krrish franchise cementing Rakesh’s reputation as a visionary director. While fans eagerly await updates on Krrish 4, there’s no official word yet on its release. tags : bollywood Jeetendra Rakesh Roshan Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 16:46 IST News movies Rakesh Roshan Recalls A Drunk Man Abusing Him And Jeetendra At A Restaurant: 'We’re Soft Targets’ Read More",

Months after the devastating incident, the attacker, 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana, has been sentenced to 52 years in prison. The victims—7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, 6-year-old Bebe King, and 9-year-old Alice da Silva Aguiar—lost their lives, while eight other children and two adults were injured. During the trial, Judge Julian Goose explained that, as Rudakubana was a minor at the time of the crime, he could not receive a life sentence without parole. Instead, he was handed a lengthy sentence to reflect the severity of his actions. According to the Associated Press (AP), Goose stated that Rudakubana “wanted to try and carry out mass murder of innocent, happy young girls.\" During the trial at Liverpool Crown Court, when prosecutors began showing evidence, the attacker interrupted them by claiming he was feeling ill and asked for a doctor. Due to constant disturbance, he was removed from the courtroom. The trial continued without Rudakubana, where he was charged with three murders, ten attempted murders and other offences, including having a knife, ricin poison and an al-Qaida manual. related stories Prosecutor Deanna Heer explained that during the summer vacation, 26 young girls were sitting together, making bracelets and singing Taylor Swift songs. The suspect arrived at the Hart Space venue in a taxi. Holding a knife, he entered the building and started attacking the girls and their teacher brutally. Heer claimed two dead children “suffered particularly horrific injuries which are difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature.\" Reportedly, one girl managed to reach the exit, but the attacker pulled her back inside. While she was shockingly stabbed 32 times but survived. One of the girls who couldn’t survive, had 122 injuries, while another had 85 wounds. The prosecutor further shed light on Axel Rudakubana’s long history of violence and killing. According to Deanna Heer, “His only purpose was to kill. And he targeted the youngest and most vulnerable in society.\" While in the police station, the 18-year-old was heard saying “It’s a good thing those children are dead, I’m so glad, I’m so happy.\" This was heard in front of the victims’ families present in the courtroom. tags : entertainment hollywood Taylor Swift Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 16:43 IST News movies Teen Sentenced To 52 Years For Killing 3 Young Taylor Swift Fans At UK Dance Class Read More",

(Photo Credits: Instagram) After years of intense scrutiny and a lengthy investigation, shock rocker Marilyn Manson will reportedly not face criminal charges for allegations of rape and domestic violence. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office announced the decision on Friday, bringing an official close to the four-year investigation into accusations levelled against Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner. In a detailed statement, District Attorney Nathan J Hochman explained the decision, citing two primary factors: the expiration of the statute of limitations on the domestic violence claims and insufficient evidence to prove sexual assault charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The investigation was a collaborative effort between the DA’s Sex Crimes Division and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, reports Entertainment Weekly. related stories “We recognise and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation,\" the statement read. The DA’s office further emphasised the importance of the survivors’ advocacy, noting how their voices have shone a light on the obstacles faced by those who endure domestic abuse and sexual violence. While no charges will be filed, Hochman reportedly reaffirmed the office’s dedication to pursuing justice for survivors. “We encourage anyone experiencing abuse to seek support and make a report to law enforcement as quickly as possible,\" the statement concluded. Manson’s attorney, Howard King, expressed relief at the outcome, stating, “We are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start: Brian Warner is innocent.\" Manson, now 56, has been at the centre of multiple allegations in recent years. High-profile accusations reportedly came from actress and former fiancee Evan Rachel Wood and Game of Thrones star Esme Bianco. Wood accused Manson of grooming her as a teenager and subjecting her to horrific abuse during their relationship, which she detailed in the 2022 HBO documentary Phoenix Rising. She also alleged that Manson “essentially raped\" her during the filming of his Heart-Shaped Glasses music video. In response, Manson filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood in 2022 but later dropped the case, agreeing to pay her legal fees. Bianco filed her own civil lawsuit in 2021, accusing Manson of sexual assault and human trafficking. That case was settled in 2023, informs Entertainment Weekly. Reacting to the DA’s decision not to press charges, Bianco shared her disappointment but acknowledged it didn’t come as a surprise. “Once again, our justice system has failed survivors,\" she wrote in a social media post on Friday. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Esmé Bianco (@esmebianco) “My healing and peace could not be reliant upon the outcome of a desperately broken system.\" She ended her message with a pointed note directed at Manson. “By you dragging me through hell, I discovered the unstoppable force of my own power,\" her statement read. tags : entertainment hollywood marilyn manson Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 16:25 IST News movies No Charges Filed Against Marilyn Manson Following Rape And Domestic Violence Claims, Here's Why Read More",

I LOVE YOU ANTHONY FOREVER,\" the post read. related stories A representative from his former label Big Oomp Records has paid tribute to the singer. “It is with a heavy heart and profound sadness that we announce the passing of a true ATL legend, Anthony Platt better known as ‘DJ Unk.’ DJ Unk was not just a legendary DJ, rapper, and producer, but a true cornerstone of our label, and the imprint that he left globally will be cherished forever,\" the label said.

I constantly am on the go, I constantly am on airplanes, in different weather and you know it just took a toll on me. It was stress,\" he said. DJ Unk began his musical career at the very young age of 17, linking up with DJ Jelly and DJ Montay. He later signed with Big Oomp Records and released his debut album Beat’n Down Yo Block in 2006.

Urvashi Rautela hit the headlines last week after she faced flak for her comments about Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan’s attack. While condemning the attack, the actress shifted the conversation to discuss expensive gifts that her parents had given her after the success of her film ‘Daaku Maharaaj’. She flaunted her diamond-studded Rolex and other jewellery, which many found tone-deaf and insensitive. She then apologized on Instagram, but later deleted the post. Now, in a recent interview, Urvashi explained that she was caught off guard and was unaware of the full details of the attack on Saif Ali Khan. While speaking with Filmfare, Urvashi Rautela said that the question about Saif Ali Khan caught her off guard because the attack happened at 4 am, and she had an interview the next morning while she was still processing the news. “I think I should have been way more careful with the way I answered. I have to admit that I should have answered it more carefully. Also, the incident happened at 4 am (Saif’s attack), and very next day my interviews happened at 8 am. So, I was completely kind of clueless. All I remember is that when I was waking up someone told me, he got hurt. I don’t know the intensity of how he got hurt. I wasn’t aware of the intensity of what all has happened with him,\" she said. related stories She said that she kept bringing up her film Daaku Maharaaj as the interviews were lined up to celebrate the success of her film. She also admitted that the excitement about her parents’ gifts caused her to go off-topic, and that it was a moment of misplaced enthusiasm rather than an attempt to ‘show-off’.  “I came back to my film Daaku Maharaaj because the interviews were to celebrate its success. Unlike what some people think, I was also not referring to that daaku (intruder) as a maharaaj. I love my parents; I feel they are my god. I got a bit too excited with the kind of gifts I got. Hum Hindi mai bolte hai na, josh mai hosh kho dena. Wahi hua mere saath. But show off toh nahi tha. Kyunki agar show off hota toh main chhoti si mini watch nahi dikhaati. (Like we say in Hindi, I lost it in the passion, that’s what happened. It was definitely not show off. Because if it was, I wouldn’t have shown a small mini watch),\" said Urvashi. What Did Urvashi Rautela Say About Attack On Saif Ali Khan? In an interview with ANI, Urvashi was asked to comment on Saif’s situation. While expressing concern, her remarks veered towards showcasing her luxury items. Referring to the attack at Saif’s Mumbai residence, Urvashi said, “It is very unfortunate. Now Daaku Maharaaj has crossed ₹105 crore at the box office, and my mother gifted me this diamond-studded Rolex, while my father gifted me this mini watch on my finger, but we don’t feel confident wearing it outside openly. There is this insecurity that anybody can attack us. Whatever happened was very unfortunate.\" For the unversed, Saif Ali Khan was stabbed by an intruder who allegedly broke into his Mumbai residence on January 16. The actor suffered multiple injuries, including one near his spine and another on his neck. He was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where he underwent surgeries. tags : bollywood Saif ali khan Urvashi Rautela Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 16:05 IST News movies Urvashi Rautela REACTS To Her Comments On Saif Ali Khan Attack: ‘Show Off Hota Toh Mini Watch Nahi Dikhaati’ Read More",

(Photo Credits: Instagram) The simmering feud between Justin Baldoni and Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds has taken a sharp turn, with Baldoni’s camp calling out what they see as a shocking double standard. They’re pushing back against the couple’s attempt to silence Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, through a gag order, describing the move as nothing short of grossly unfair. The tension reportedly escalated after Lively’s sexual harassment claims, initially published by The New York Times, sparked widespread attention. Now, Baldoni’s camp is calling out what they see as an attempt to silence Freedman, who has been vocal in defending his client. “It’s grossly unfair,\" insiders close to the It Ends With Us director reportedly said, adding that the couple’s motion to prevent Freedman from speaking to the media is “unbelievable.\" According to sources, Freedman has merely been pushing back against what they describe as Lively’s alleged “takedown campaign.\" related stories Meanwhile, representatives for Lively, 37, and Reynolds, 48, have yet to address the brewing controversy publicly, reports Page Six. The power couple has officially requested a protective order to stop Freedman from sharing any discovery materials with the press. In a letter to Judge Lewis J Liman on Tuesday, Lively’s legal team argued that Freedman’s public commentary could jeopardise the integrity of a potential trial. “As Ms Lively’s counsel have attempted, repeatedly, to caution Mr Freedman, federal litigation must be conducted in court and according to the relevant rules of professional conduct,\" the letter states, according to various reports. The letter reportedly accuses Freedman of engaging in a relentless media blitz. It claims he has given interviews, appeared on podcasts, issued “inflammatory\" statements and leaked documents, some as seemingly minor as preservation demands, to the entertainment press and tabloids “almost daily\" since Lively filed her complaint on December 20. Furthermore, the couple’s legal team alleges that Freedman’s actions are “deliberately aimed at undermining the ‘character, credibility and reputation’ of numerous relevant parties,\" informs Page Six. This legal clash follows Baldoni’s release of raw footage from It Ends With Us, which he claims discredits Lively’s allegations. Baldoni, 40, has vehemently denied the harassment claims and is reportedly preparing to launch a website aimed at dismantling what his team sees as baseless accusations against him. With both sides locked in an increasingly bitter battle, the case is shaping up to be as dramatic as any screenplay. Whether the judge will grant Lively and Reynolds’ gag order remains to be seen, but it’s clear that neither party is backing down anytime soon. tags : Blake Lively entertainment Ryan Reynolds Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 14:26 IST News movies Justin Baldoni Hits Back At Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds' Gag Order Request Read More",

On Friday, television producer Vinta Nanda took to social media and called out the Oscars’ system of nominating films. Without name-dropping, she wrote, “Systems are so flawed now. Curators walk away with the Oscar nominations and awards as producers and the struggle of the artists and their producers is completely eclipsed. What kind of a world are we living in?\" The post met with a lot of attention, including filmmaker-actor Ananth Mahadevan, who pointed fingers at ‘influential ones’ with ‘connections/networking’. Through her post, Vinta took a jibe at Anuja, which secured a nomination for Best Live Action Short at the 97th Academy Awards. Speaking exclusively to News18 Showsha, Vinta says, “The producers of Anuja are featured nowhere near Guneet Monga (Kapoor) and Priyanka Chopra (Jonas). Theirs are the first two names featured in the list of producers. I’m sure Anuja is a brilliant film much like The Elephant Whisperers. But it’s becoming a norm year after year that after a film gets made, well-recognisable names with great network suddenly come and become producers.\" related stories She further adds, “What they’re actually doing is curating and becoming part and parcel of the profits and business of the film. Technically, they aren’t the producers. They shouldn’t be going up on the stage and collecting those awards. People involved with marketing, taking the film from the producers – after it’s ready – to festivals and lobbying, get credit for the film, which they haven’t even partaken in. They should be making sure that the team that has actually produced the film takes the honour.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vinta Nanda (@vintananda) However, she isn’t the one to be blaming Guneet or Priyanka. “No offense to them because they’re brilliant in their own right and have done stellar work in their lives. They’re part of a system that’s so flawed. Why should festivals be seeking their approval? They think the media won’t give them coverage if a Priyanka Chopra doesn’t come on top of the product? I’ve put my post questioning this. What’s happening in the bargain is that real writers, directors and producers don’t come in notice,\" Vinta states. She further points out that Anuja’s Oscars nod and Guneet’s induction into the Academy is a ‘conflict of interest’. She opines, “The Oscars share a symbiotic relationship with Guneet. She has done some great work and she has brought home the Oscars. Even for The Elephant Whisperers, she only came into it at the editing stage. She didn’t have anything to do with it till the first cut was already ready. She was able to bridge the gap between the filmmaker and the Oscars.\" Vinta continues, “What the Oscars organisers and Guneet need to introspect is, if this is a good thing that they’re doing. What if certain films don’t come to Guneet’s notice? A producer already making films may not be the right conduit because there may be biases there. I’m sure she or Priyanka isn’t biased and is very fair but it’s not the right way to go. As it is, the lesser names are where the material is because they’re the ones to be actually making a film.\" At the same time, Vinta reiterates how this process often ‘puts too much responsibility’ on people like Guneet and Priyanka. “Awards, festivals and funders need to find the right talent. There must be 20-30 other good films in the market, which they don’t even know exist. They can’t say that Guneet likes a film and so, I also like it. It’s an unhealthy kind of a space we’re getting into and it’s going to be a harmful and unhealthy ecosystem for creative storytellers to exist. The pressure is going to be so much. It’s so oppressive already,\" she exclaims. tags : bollywood guneet monga Oscars priyanka chopra Showsha Exclusives Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 04:50 IST News movies Vinta Nanda Reacts To Credit War, Criticises Oscars: 'Priyanka, Guneet Didn't Even Partake In Making Anuja’ | Exclusive Read More",

She adds being 'mansplained' by viewers for being a cricket presenter. reset Follow us on Google News Sahiba Bali recently confessed having a crush on Pat Cummins. Over the years, Sahiba Bali has become a popular name in the fields of acting, cricket presenting, influencing and content creation. And along with fame and success has come brutal trolling. Often, she has also been linked up with her contemporaries like stand-up comics Kullu aka Aaditya Kulshrestha and Samay Raina. In an exclusive chat with News18 Showsha, she sets the record straight and reflects, “People think I’m married with a child also. I think this happens because I’m not married. This happens to a lot of women who’re single and works with peers, who’re mostly men.\" So, how does she deal with link-up rumours? “I’ve been linked with comedians, cricketers and actors, and when I read such reports, I always find it funny. It never bothers me. Only if they knew what our relationship is like! What I do is take screenshots and send them ahead to the person I’ve been linked with. Half of those boys are either like my brothers or share a super platonic relationship with me. They’re people with who I cannot have a relationship with,\" Sahiba states. related stories However, there’s one thing that bogs her down. “What bothers me is when they say that I’m working or hanging out with a person because I want to be with them, and that’s really unfair. Some people I’ve been linked with has also spoken out about how it’s the woman in the equation who always gets targeted. What people say about me, they won’t ever say about the guy and that hurts. The meanest thing I’ve heard about myself is that I use people and that’s why I’m successful. Such a horrible thing to say!\" Sahiba further adds, “I may have more followers than them and have worked more but I still bear the brunt. But as long as those around me and I know my truth, it’s fine. Moments like these remind me of what I used to hear while growing up that even bad PR is PR. So, when people talk about me or my personal life, I tell myself that they’re at least interested in me, so it’s good.\" A while back, India’s Got Latent’s Kullu, who also happens to be Sahiba’s frequent collaborator, took to social media to call out trolls attacking Sahiba for ‘using’ him for views and engagement. As Sahiba discusses the flipside of popularity, she also emphasises on what it means to be navigating a male-dominated space. “I haven’t been mansplained by the men I’m working with but by my viewers. Being a woman in cricket brings with it a lot of questions. Main technical baatein karti nahi hoon ki kab off-spinner ko aana hai, kab fast bowler ko aana chahiye ya ball off-side jaa rahi hai because I know that I don’t have that kind of credibility. But they don’t understand that I’m not a commentator or an analyst,\" the Laila Majnu and Amar Singh Chamkila actor remarks. tags : bollywood Showsha Exclusives Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 04:21 IST News movies Actor Sahiba Bali Recalls 'Horrible' Things Said About Her: 'I Use People For Success' | Exclusive Read More",

Kudumbasthan U 2.5 /5 24 January 2025 | Tamil 2 hrs 35 mins | Comedy, Drama Starring: Manikandan, Saanve Megghana, Guru Somasundaram Director: Rajeshwar Kalisamy Watch Trailer Kudumbasthan Movie Review: Kudumbasthan’s premise taps into an evergreen theme in Tamil cinema, which is the struggles of a middle-class protagonist trying to make ends meet. The film’s title itself evokes memories of classics from filmmakers like Bhagyaraj, Visu, and actor Saravanan, who have explored similar themes in their comedy dramas across generations. The story revolves around Naveen (Manikandan), a typical middle-class youngster from a small town in Coimbatore, who is newly married to Vennila (Saanve Megghana). Naveen works as a designer at a local marketing company, earning just enough to sustain their modest life. Meanwhile, Vennila prepares for the UPSC exams while managing household responsibilities and battling caste-based discrimination from her mother-in-law. Their lives take a turn when Naveen, in a moment of self-respect, slaps a client and loses his job. What follows is a downward spiral of financial struggles, debt, and deception, with no apparent way out. related stories Debutant director Rajeshwar Kalisamy, known for his work with the popular YouTube channel Nakkalites, brings his signature comedic style and familiar faces from the channel to the big screen. However, the transition yields mixed results. While the comedy segments occasionally land well, Kudumbasthan fails to deliver the laugh riot it aspires to be, often resembling a series of YouTube sketches stitched together rather than a cohesive narrative. The film unfolds in disconnected segments—starting with Naveen and Vennila’s marriage against their families’ wishes, moving on to Naveen’s conflicts with his brother-in-law Rajendran (Guru Somasundaram), a chaotic wedding anniversary celebration for Naveen’s parents and his misadventures in real estate. Each segment feels like a standalone skit, lacking seamless flow and emotional depth. When the humour works, it does so effectively, but the success rate is inconsistent. The film constantly strives for laughs in every scene, often at the expense of emotional beats that needed space to resonate. Even during the climax, the makers introduce parallel comedic tracks that undercut the film’s emotional weight. Additionally, Kudumbasthan struggles with tonal consistency – one moment portraying moneylenders as menacing villains, and the next reducing them to caricatures. A fatherly boss is turned into a clown with a slap, only to be redeemed via a phone call. Ultimately, Kudumbasthan sacrifices narrative coherence for humour at every opportunity. The film attempts to balance comedy with serious themes like caste discrimination but handles them with an uneven, lighthearted approach. It wants viewers to empathise with Naveen’s plight while simultaneously mocking him, making it difficult to stay emotionally invested. While such an approach might work for short online sketches, as a full-length feature, Kudumbasthan needed to take itself more seriously because comedy, after all, is serious business. tags : Movie Reviews regional cinema Location : Chennai, India First Published: January 25, 2025, 01:08 IST News movies Kudumbasthan Review: A Middling Comedy That Struggles To Balance Humour And Emotion Read More",

Jennifer Aniston has once again found herself at the centre of media speculation as resurfaced rumours suggest an alleged romance with former U.S. President Barack Obama. Although the Friends star had previously dismissed the rumours, they have gained traction amid ongoing speculation surrounding Barack and Michelle Obama’s marriage. Concerns about the couple’s relationship intensified after Michelle Obama skipped significant public events, including Jimmy Carter’s funeral and Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. While the Obamas have neither confirmed nor denied any separation, online chatter continues to fuel speculation. The rumours linking Aniston to Obama first emerged last year when InTouch magazine published an article titled The Truth About Jen & Barack. They have since resurfaced, with fans pointing to signs of tension within the Obama household. related stories RELATED | Jennifer Aniston BREAKS Silence On Affair Rumours With Barack Obama: ‘I Know Michelle…’ | Viral During a 2024 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Aniston laughed off the speculation, saying, “Of all the calls you get from your publicist where you’re like, ‘Oh no, what’s it gonna be?’ Or the emails saying some cheesy tabloid’s going to make up a story and then it’s that.\" She further clarified, “I was not mad at it… I know Michelle [Obama] more than him.\" As the rumours persist, let’s take a look at Jennifer Aniston’s notable relationships over the years. Justin Theroux (2010–2018) Aniston’s most recent long-term relationship was with actor Justin Theroux. The couple first crossed paths in 2007 but reconnected in 2010 while filming Wanderlust. Their romance quickly blossomed, and by August 2011, they had moved in together. They tied the knot in an intimate ceremony at their Bel Air, California, home on August 5, 2015. View this post on Instagram A post shared by People Magazine (@people) However, in early 2018, the pair announced their split in a joint statement. “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,\" they wrote. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\" Despite their breakup, the two have maintained a close friendship and have been seen publicly supporting each other. John Mayer (2008–2009) Jennifer Aniston and singer John Mayer met at an Oscars party in early 2008 and embarked on an on-and-off romance that lasted about a year. “It’s funny when you hit a place in a relationship and you both realize, we maybe need to do something else, but you still really, really love each other,\" Aniston said post-breakup. “It’s painful. I deeply, deeply care about him; we talk, we adore one another. And that’s where it is.\" Vince Vaughn (2005–2006) Following her highly publicised split from Brad Pitt, Aniston found solace in actor Vince Vaughn while filming The Break-Up. The relationship provided a much-needed distraction from her divorce, and Aniston later credited Vaughn with helping her move forward. “He brought me back to life,\" she admitted in a candid interview. However, the relationship ended in late 2006 on amicable terms. Brad Pitt (1998–2005) One of Aniston’s most high-profile relationships was with Hollywood A-lister Brad Pitt. The former couple first met through their managers in 1994 but didn’t start dating until 1998. They made their red carpet debut at the 1999 Emmy Awards and got engaged the same year at a Sting concert. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jen and Brad (@anistonpitt) The duo tied the knot in a lavish Malibu wedding on July 29, 2000. In 2001, Pitt made a memorable guest appearance on Friends, playing a character who despised Aniston’s Rachel Green. However, cracks in their marriage began to show in 2004, when rumours swirled that Pitt had developed feelings for Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith. By January 2005, the couple announced their divorce, shocking fans worldwide. Tate Donovan (1995–1998) Aniston dated actor Tate Donovan for over two years following his breakup with Sandra Bullock. Ironically, Donovan was cast as Rachel Green’s love interest on Friends shortly after their real-life split, which made for some awkward moments on set. Adam Duritz (1995) Before dating Courteney Cox, Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz briefly dated Aniston after they met through mutual friends.

According to Gold Derby, the competition is currently too close to call, with Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft and Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter tied, each garnering four votes from the site’s experts and editors.

Her success further cements her status as one of the biggest names in the music industry. The 67th Grammy Awards will take place at LA’s Crypto.com Arena. The ceremony will not only celebrate the achievements of the music community but will also serve as a fundraiser for wildfire relief efforts.

Such was the response that the film even turned out to be the fastest earner of all time, even surpassing the giants like RRR, Pushpa 2 and Baahubali 2. related stories During the ten days, Sankranthiki Vasthunam grossed Rs 140 crore plus in the Telugu states. Before the film, the top two highest-grossing Sankranti releases in the Telugu states were AVPL and Waltair Veeraya with a gross collection of Rs 196 crore and Rs 171 crore respectively. Seems like the latest release will easily surpass Waltair Veeraya’s box-office collection comfortably. That too, in the second week of its release itself. Sankranthiki Vasthunam hit the theatres on January 14 and has been running successfully ever since. Owing to the Telugu film’s success, the makers hosted a party, with the film’s team and stars in attendance. The official X handle of Sri Venkateswara Creations gave a peek into the success party of Sankranthiki Vasthunam. Mahesh Babu also attended the party and looked handsome in a black shirt teamed with denim pants and a red cap. His wife, Namrata Shirodkar, also joined him for the bash. ICYDK, Sankranthiki Vasthunam is an action-comedy about the story of a former IPS officer who finds himself indulged in a high-profile kidnapping case at his ex-girlfriend’s insistence. The plot takes an investing turn as his wife, suspicious of her husband’s loyalty, also joins them. tags : box office regional cinema Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 24, 2025, 19:25 IST News movies Sankranthiki Vasthunam Box-Office Collection: Venkatesh Daggubati’s Film To Enter Rs 200 Crore Club Read More",

We are keeping them in loop since it’s an international case but they aren’t actively involved yet. It will take some time to identify the sender of this email. But it’s true, the threat email was real. He has written his name as Bishnu. Now we don’t know if it’s a real person or somebody playing mischief. That is yet to be confirmed. The police are taking this case very seriously and we will definitely find the culprit. The investigation is still ongoing as of now.\" Sadashiv Nikam added, “First we had received the complaint of Rajpal Yadav that we lodged on December 17. Then there was a threat message to Kapil Sharma and his team members as well. They approached us and we immediately filed the FIR and started the investigation by joining hands with the cyber police and other officers. As of now, they are accessing the data of that IP. The IP location has been traced to Pakistan and that is why we need the CBI to intervene. But this will take time because gaining information from Pakistan is very difficult.\" He also revealed, “The threats sent to Sugandha Mishra and Remo D’Souza has been lodged in the Oshiwara police station.\" This all started in December when Kapil Sharma, along with other celebrities received a death threat via email signed off under the name “BISHNU.\" As per the reports, the email read, “We are monitoring your recent activities and we believe it is important that we bring to your attention a sensitive matter.

Actress Samantha Ruth Prabhu is donning several hats now. She dabbles between her acting career, her role as a producer, and as the owner of Chennai Super Champs, the pickleball team that is part of the ongoing World Pickleball League. However, Samantha doesn’t betray any sense of urgency or wear-out as CNN-News18 caught up with her for a small chat during the jersey launch of her team at Sathyabama University in Chennai. The actress revealed the reason behind owning a pickleball team, her return to Tamil cinema after a long gap, and teaming up with Raj and DK again for Rakht Brahma. Here’s an excerpt from the interview: related stories When did you exactly fall in love with this sport? When I realized it wasn’t intimidating (laughs) Growing up, my focus was always on education, never on sports—never picked up any baggage, ever. So, I was always very intimidated by it. Again, I hate losing. I can’t lose. A sore loser. So, picking up a sport later in life means losing a lot, which is not my cup of tea. But there’s something about pickleball that isn’t intimidating. Something about pickleball players who, they’re warm, they’re mighty, they’re angry, competitive. It’s also gender and age-agnostic. Among the pickleball players, 45% are women. And it’s also fun to watch because it’s not very fast, but fast enough. But playing a game is different from owning a team? Yeah, I am gutsy like that (laughs). As an actor, for the past 15 to 16 years, everything has been about me for the longest time. Now, it’s time to be part of something bigger than me. I’m ambitious, but ambition should also have to tie you up with a higher purpose. I believe that anything that I put my money in, or my heart, has to have a greater impact on society. Otherwise, it’s useless. If not now, then when? So, anything that I do… Most of my business projects are centred around physical fitness. It all ties in very well together in this. Tell us about the Chennai Super Champs? Chennai Super Champs was a no-brainer. The first team that I wanted was immediately Chennai. I had to have Chennai. I remember being asked about other teams other than Chennai. I was like, “NO WAY.\" From playing on the streets of Chennai to representing the city. It has been a journey. Chennai gave me my never-die and never-give-up attitude. It gave me resilience and an equal playing field. I didn’t even know about my bad socioeconomic status back then, because Chennai never makes you feel that way. Chennai is an equal playing field for everyone. And that’s what I love about this city. That’s why I always come back and give back to the city. Is there a reason the name “Chennai Super Champs\" sort of rhymes with one of the most popular teams? Yes. It does for the same reason. If you’re going for the dream, might as well just go the whole way. So why not? It’s been a while since we saw you in Tamil cinema? (Samantha was last seen in Kollywood in Vijay Sethupathi’s 2022 film Kaathuvaakula Rendu Kaadhal). Right. I know. Well, I realized that it’s easy to do many films. But… I’m at the point of time in my life where every film must feel like the last. It must have that kind of effect. If I don’t 100% believe in it, I can’t even get myself to do it. So I am waiting. Trust me. More than anyone else. I am waiting for that wonderful film. And I don’t want to let anyone down or let myself down with my choices. You’re teaming up with Raj and DK again for Rakht Brahmand. So thoughts on that? I think with Family Man, I was able to portray something that I’ve never done before. Again with Citadel Honey Bunny, it was something that I hadn’t done before. And again with Rakht  Brahmand, things are more challenging. Raj and DK have spoiled me for good reason. They are the ones who inspired me to want more and more challenges. When I go to work every day, it is extremely fulfilling as an actor. For being able to give that much to the world. And if I don’t get that feeling every day, I don’t want to go to work. tags : bollywood OTT Raj and DK regional cinema Samantha Ruth Prabhu Showsha Exclusives Location : Chennai, India First Published: January 24, 2025, 17:40 IST News movies Samantha Ruth Prabhu On Teaming Up WIth Raj & DK For Rakht Brahmand: 'They’ve Spoiled Me With Challenges’ | Exclusive Read More",

Born to Madan and Rupa Tamang, he stepped into adulthood early following his father’s untimely demise. Leaving his studies at St. Robert’s School in Darjeeling, he joined the Kolkata Police as a constable, where he continued to nurture his love for music by performing in the police orchestra. In 2007, he took a leap of faith and auditioned for the third season of Indian Idol.

His victory not only catapulted him to fame but also brought immense pride to the Nepali-speaking community.

His career flourished with nationwide and international concert tours, including performances in the United States. He also lent his voice to Nepali films like Himmat 2.

And I have questioned some people that I trust, not just as artists but as people, and they don’t feel that way, so I am trying to understand. The first time that I saw it, I told Jacques, ‘You’re a genius.’ I was crying, I felt moved, and I was, like, ‘I am so grateful that I’m part of this project’.\" “I really appreciate Emilia, because it’s a spectacle and its songs and dancing, but it’s not like any other musical. It’s not perfect dancing and a perfect sound. The music is dirty, full of pain, erratic, like the sensation of living in Mexico,\" Adriana Paz shared.

Actor Shahid Kapoor recently opened up about his childhood experiences, reflecting on the impact of his parents’ separation and the absence of his father during his formative years. Raised by his mother, Neliima Azeem, in Delhi, Shahid revealed that he would only see his father, Pankaj Kapur, once a year, leaving a significant void in his life. In an interview with Raj Shamani on YouTube, he discussed how this shaped his understanding of parenting and the challenges he faced growing up. Shahid shared, “I did come from a home where my parents were not together from the age of three. I lived a lot with my mom. I would see my father only once a year. So the male presence in my life was less; much, much less than what is normal.\" He likened the absence of one parent to losing a sense of balance: “Parents are like your two feet but when one parent is not there, you feel like you can’t balance because one foot is missing. It’s naturally meant to be a certain way so the way the world is made, both parents have a role in that. You cannot define it.\" related stories Although his father wasn’t a daily presence, Shahid credited his maternal grandfather for being a constant and unconditionally supportive figure in his life. He said, “If I look back now, he is the deepest influence in my life, but I am sure he was filling in the shoes of my dad not being there every day. He was unconditionally there for me. My strongest memory as a child is with my Nanaji.\" Shahid also spoke about being bullied as a child because of his family situation. “Kids are very mean. So, at that time, when you don’t have a parent, they make you feel bad about it, that this is not normal. And other kids made me feel that. Those kids don’t know what they are doing, they are just being stupid but you end up feeling like my life is over.\" As a parent to daughter Misha (8) and son Zain (6), Shahid reflected on how his childhood experiences influence his approach to fatherhood. He explained how being a parent brings a mix of emotions, including questioning one’s own parents. “Sometimes you might feel that I can’t be as good as my father or mother, or sometimes you might feel like I am doing a lot, why didn’t my parents do as much? You can feel both ways and both are just as valid.\" He further noted the impact of a father’s presence on his children, particularly his son. “When I am not around, I feel he doesn’t feel as secure, even for my daughter, but I would say more for my son. Because I think that male energy connect between father and son, I don’t know it works but probably as father and child, we feed off each other.\" Shahid, who shares a close bond with his father now, acknowledged that their relationship improved significantly after he became an actor. The two have even collaborated on several films, showcasing a renewed connection and mutual respect. Married to Mira Rajput, Shahid continues to prioritize his role as a father, drawing lessons from his past to ensure a nurturing environment for his children. tags : bollywood pankaj kapur Shahid Kapoor Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 24, 2025, 13:44 IST News movies Shahid Kapoor Recalls Childhood Bullying Due To Absent Father: ‘Parents Are Like Legs, When One Is Missing…’ Read More",

Their concerts are known for accessibility, love-themed messages, visuals, and sustainability. reset Follow us on Google News Coldplay will perform in Ahmedabad next. Music from the early 2000s, is etched in the memory of every 90s kid, listening to the melodies that were there for them on some of the most carefree and simple days of their lives evokes a sense of nostalgia that no new hit single can ever quite compare to. So, when a beloved childhood artist goes on tour, tickets often sell out faster than the speed of light and as the D-day arrives, fans imagine that they’ll be singing along with someone from their birth cohort who shares their emotions, and this may be the case with other artists but not when it comes to Coldplay the band’s appeal extends beyond the barriers of age. Visuals from their India tour bear witness to this fact where the crowd comprised kids, adolescents and even families all which were singing their hearts out, making the evening no less than a night in paradise. related stories Evidently, a Coldplay concert is no longer just a concert, it’s a phenomenon, a once-in-a-lifetime adventure as many users on social media call it. But what sets the experience apart and why is their impact multi-generational? Let us dive in: Accessible Music for All One way or another, music is intertwined with every aspect of our lives – be it putting your playlist on repeat after a long day, listening to those tunes that take us back to the treasured days of childhood to even choosing your wedding anthem. Every moment is made a tad better by its presence. To make the experience accessible for all, there is a local sign language interpreter at every Coldplay show as well as Subpacs for those who are hard of hearing so that they can feel a stronger connection to the music. Apart from this, the group has also provided sensory bags and a mobile sensory refuge station for those with sensory sensitivities. Moreover, for those with low/no vision there is a touch tour before every show. Bearing the Emblem of Love and Kindness Right from the moment when the Love buttons are given to you as you enter the arena, the lyrics of their songs which talk about love aloud to Martin’s tattoo which says, ‘Love is God’ – the bands purpose is clear, they are here to spread love and every generation relates to it. Anisha, 23, who will soon be attending the concert and has been following the band’s journey for over a decade, says that ‘Even at fourteen I could deeply connect with their lyrics.\" Furthermore, she shares that what’s unique about the band is that they are ‘Universally relatable which allows their music to resonate with every age group, in fact according to her if aliens listened to their music even, they would find something meaningful in it.\" A Visual Treat Unlike other concerts, attending a Coldplay live show is a unique experience. The famous ‘Moon Goggles’ offer a fun way to view the world, and seeing the sky light up with hearts and stars is something many people look forward to. In addition, the Xylo bands change colour with each song, vibrant lights move across the crowd, fireworks brighten the night sky, and large video screens highlight every moment. Sustainability While the magic of Coldplay’s concerts captivates fans across generations, their commitment extends beyond the stage. In 2019, Coldplay announced they would not tour until they found a way to reduce carbon emissions during their concert, and as of 2024 they have managed to cut down 59% of carbon dioxide emissions during the MOTS tour in contrast to their previous tour. They have achieved this via reusing LED concert wristbands that are made from recycled material for different shows, by installing power bikes and kinetic floors through which fans can generate power for the show by cycling or dancing. In fact, even the vivid confetti that’s used to light up the sky is 100% biodegradable. Moreover, the band has committed to planting a tree for every ticket sold due to which 7 million trees have been planted across 24 countries. These efforts have struck a chord with Gen-Z, who according to a representative from TINEB (There Is No Earth B) considers ‘Sustainability Personal, which is why they genuinely prefer events that demonstrate real commitment to sustainability’. Meanwhile, the band is all set to play their biggest show yet at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, tickets for which are already sold out. Thus, reiterating the fact that the Coldplay fever is far from fading and will make its impact on generations to come! tags : Coldplay Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 24, 2025, 10:17 IST News movies Decades Later, Here's Why Coldplay Remains...",

(Image: News18 & PTI) The New Delhi Assembly seat is one of the largest seats in Delhi in terms of area. However, this is the second smallest seat in terms of vote count. But when it comes to its VVIP stature, no seat comes close. This election, the seat is witnessing two sons of former Chief Ministers and a former CM himself engaged in a triangular ‘Battle Royale’. While former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Sahib Singh’s son Parvesh Verma and Sheila Dikshit’s son Sandeep Dikshit are the main contenders from the AAP, BJP and Congress respectively, there are a total of 23 contenders trying their luck from the seat. Kejriwal has been an MLA from this seat three times and this is the fourth time he has filed his nomination. related stories 2 NEW DELHIS — OF OFFICERS & SLUMS There were 1,46,000 voters here in 2020. Now this number is around 1,90,000. Most of the government offices are here, and most officers reside in this area and have voting rights in this seat. But New Delhi is not just about officers, it has another side — group D staff, and slums. This unique constituency has residences of union ministers, and members of Parliaments while housing their help on the back of their official residences. Government high risers like MS flats that house MPs, accommodate their helps in the rear section in the staff quarters. Everyone has a voting right, which makes them equal during elections. There are also a significant number of Other Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes in this assembly seat. The seat also has a fair number of voters from the Dhobi community. During campaigning, every political party reaches out to every section of the society. While many MPs don’t have voting rights here but in their respective constituencies , their staff and their families become an ideal catch for parties of all hues. ISSUES FOR NEW DELHI There is no dearth of issues in Delhi. But as long as one is in New Delhi, there are primarily three issues. But it all depends on which New Delhi is one talking about — Todarmal Road, Bengali Market, Mathura Road, Khan Market or Balmiki Mandir, Dhobi Ghat, Staff quarters of MS flats or JJ Clusters at ITO? The residents of the former will be vocal about air pollution. However, the moment you approach residents of the latter, jobs top their concerns. But the roughly 15,000 Dhobis or the washermen of New Delhi are not happy with the AAP given their long-standing complaints have never been heard. But Kejriwal realised that it could hurt him and announced, “If our government is formed, the Delhi government will establish a ‘Dhobi Samuday Welfare Board’. The dhobi community does not have a single platform to voice their issues.\" He also promised the youth from the Dhobi community to provide skill training for their traditional profession. This seems to have contained the damage, gauging the emotion of Bhurelal, who has been in this profession for ages, “He seems sincere. I will give him another chance.\" THE CAMPAIGN Though this is a three-way battle, the campaign has seen a sharp fight between the BJP and the AAP where much is at stake for the AAP National Convenor. Unlike previous elections, Kejriwal is not joking with his voters. Instead, a rattled AAP has complained against Parvesh Verma for distributing freebies, which Verma rubbished . This reporter caught Parvesh Verma catching some breath in between a non-stop door-to-door campaign and filling his stomach with sweet potatoes which he bought from the roadside. “We will win easily. Kejriwal will face not just defeat but a humiliating defeat this time. People are angry at the extent of corruption he has indulged in,\" said Verma while brisk walking. He added that pollution is a key election issue which the AAP government has much to answer for according to him. Sandeep Dikshit, whose mother Sheila Dikshit used to represent this constituency once and is running a spirited campaign for Congress, alleged, “Money is being distributed… both BJP, AAP are involved in this.\" He is leaning back to his mother’s legacy of the good old days when he claims promises were delivered. X FACTOR So, the legitimate question is, who has an edge? There is one X factor that will play an important role in deciding that — the Balmikis — around 20,000 of them in this constituency scattered around who can influence and switch verdicts.

They alleged that the Delhi Police, which comes under the Centre, has turned a blind eye on the alleged attacks on Kejriwal in accordance with Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s order. “There are two players involved in this conspiracy to kill Kejriwalji — the BJP and the Delhi Police.

The letter complained that police “simply acted as mute spectators\" and did not make an attempt to protect Kejriwal. The chief ministers called the Union home ministry’s reported order to withdraw the Punjab Police’s security cover for Kejriwal in Delhi a “politically-motivated\" decision. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) reportedly asked to withdraw the Punjab Police’s security cover for Kejriwal in Delhi as he already enjoys Z-plus security here. “The Punjab Police, which has been a crucial and reliable component of his security detail, has been abruptly withdrawn without consultation or justification. This reckless and politically-motivated decision has left Kejriwal entirely dependent on the Delhi Police — a force directly controlled by the BJP through its government at the Centre,\" they said in the letter. Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav on Thursday said the police personnel from his state deployed for Kejriwal’s security have been withdrawn. “Following directions from the Delhi Police and the EC, we withdrew the component of the Punjab Police in the security of Kejriwalji,\" Yadav said. The AAP leaders urged the EC to “conduct an immediate and thorough review of Arvind Kejriwal’s security arrangements and implement robust measures to ensure his safety\" and “reinstate or augment the presence of the Punjab Police in his security detail to provide reliable and impartial protection\".

The Congress will form the government and will always do the positive and growing work for the people,\" he said, adding people remember and miss the Congress government under Sheila Dikshit. Luthra said nothing good has been done by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. BOTH AAP, BJP DID NO DEVELOPMENT: LUTHRA Attacking outgoing AAP MLA Satyendar Jain, Luthra said despite being the health minister, Jain did not develop the health infrastructure in his own constituency. “He had been behind bars for months and years. No development on roads, water sanitation, health and education has been done. Jain was involved in corruption only,\" he said. When asked who his main contest is in the elections, Luthra said he is not considering any party – the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and AAP –  a challenge. He accused Jain of being involved in corruption, while BJP’s Karnail Singh is an outsider. He said the public doesn’t want corrupt representatives. “Jain was involved in corruption scandals, including money laundering and the liquor scam. On the other hand, Singh is an outsider who isn’t familiar with the local issues of Basti. There is no possibility for him to work on the ground level,\" he explained. Luthra went on to say that both AAP and BJP are responsible for the lack of development in Delhi. He cited a 2015 report “Jostling for Jhuggi Land,\" published in Down to Earth, explaining how thousands of the city’s most vulnerable were thrown into homelessness under BJP’s central leadership and AAP’s state governance. “The report documented the anguish of those displaced due to political indifference and endless blame games. Today, history is set to repeat itself as fresh demolition orders once again threaten the very existence of Delhi’s marginalised residents. Instead of protecting the poor, they left them abandoned, caught in a crossfire of excuses and posturing,\" Luthra said. On what feedback he is getting from the public, Luthra said during his engagement with people, he has come to realise that people are looking for change as they are fed up with the present government’s lies and blame games. IMPROVED ROADS, SEWAGE ON PRIORITY When asked what his vision for the seat is, Luthra said he aims to make Shakur Basti a model constituency in Delhi and plans to focus on providing clean water, a proper drainage and sewage system, improved road infrastructure and proper parking facilities and reducing pollution. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “I also aim to improve the constituency’s health infrastructure, ensuring that residents can proudly say they live in the best and cleanest constituency in Delhi.

Jain was also the cabinet minister in the Delhi government. Despite being a high-profile seat with a Cabinet Minister, the condition of the areas in the constituency seems miserable with issues including congestion, unrepaired and dug roads and roadside dumping of garbage. While a section of people blames it on the BJP for arresting Jain and impacting the work, another section blames it on both BJP and AAP for only indulging in fighting and not caring about the issues on ground. related stories Jain lives in Saraswati Vihar. The streets around his house were dug to install sewer lines. However, weeks, months and years went by but the condition turned worse. “Earlier, the issue was the lack of a sewer line. Now, the lanes are dug and remain unrepaired. In many parts even the sewer work is not completed. The work in a major section of the area was done by Jain in months earlier. Then he was arrested. If that had not happened, this work would have also been completed by now. By arresting the MLA, the BJP hampered the work in the area,\" said Santosh Mohan from C block in Saraswati Vihar. For a shop owner near Sir Chotu Ram Chowk in Saraswati Vihar, the battle between the AAP and BJP is not helping anyone but the voters are the ones who are impacted in reality. “I have not seen any good from the kind of fights between the two parties. None of them are bothered about the real issues on ground. There is water logging on roads even when there are no rains. The business is getting impacted due to these reasons. Why will anyone come to our shops if the drain water is flowing on the road? Who will we compensate for our loss,\" Dhirender Arora, in his 50s, said. A little walk around Mahatma Hansraj Marg is enough to spot the garbage getting piled up on the road side, inviting cows and dogs. The Ramlila Ground in Pitampura throughout the year remains a dumping ground and is cleaned only once in a while. For Amar Baweja, a resident of Jyoti Apartment next to the ground, the stray animals became a major issue, even causing accidents. “Last month, my son got injured on his way back home on bicycle. Two cows were fighting on the road and he was hurt as one of the animals hit him. This has become an everyday issue,\" he said. The area around Shakur Basti railway station is in a similar condition. Balbir Singh Sidhu Marg, the road next to the railway line, leading to the Railway Colony, is not just facing a garbage issue but also illegal parking. Kamlesh Jain, a resident of Multan Nagar, said the road has been encroached illegally. And the little space in between cars is either used for a small shop or garbage dumping points. “Crossing the road in peak office hours is a nightmare. Sometimes it takes more than 40 minutes to drive one kilometer. There is no check on why a complete lane on the road is encroached,\" he said. News18 also visited parts of Meera Bagh, Peeragarhi and Rani Bagh and the situation was no better in these areas. In all these areas, either there were no footpaths or were encroached. In some places, stalls covered the footpath while some people were living on them. The Shakur Basti assembly seat falls under the North District. It has 1.56 lakh voters – 79,753 men and 76,595 women. It falls under the Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha. Will Jain get elected for a fourth term? Jain has an appeal among the voters in the area. His vote share has consistently improved in the last three elections held in 2013 (42 per cent), 2015 (49 per cent) and 2020 (52 per cent). He bagged more than 51,000 votes in the last two elections. Speaking to News18 about the contest from the BJP, Jain said no one remembers the BJP candidates and all the votes they get is because of the party. “The public doesn’t vote for BJP based on the candidate. They may not even know who the candidate was,\" he said. Speaking about the work he has done as the PWD minister, he said ten sample roads were made which were to be used as models for all the roads.

Animals gather around these dumping zones and are a risk for children,\" said area resident Sangeeta Tomar. The same issues are faced in sectors 18, 19, 13, and 9 too. However, in some parts, the situation has improved in the last few weeks, particularly as the city administration gets ready for assembly polls in February. But many residents said the problems will return soon. While garbage on vacant plots and roadsides bothers a majority of the people in the city, most residents living in the housing societies of Rohini say that they are happy with the parks and the open-air gyms installed in these. However, some parks News18 visited were also used for drying clothes and as dumping zones. Yet a majority of the parks were well maintained and had locals enjoying the winter sun. Scenes from Rohini. Images: Nivedita Singh/News18 People living in the area were also satisfied with the electricity and water supply in the region. The voters here, more or less, seemed satisfied with the MLA and didn’t blame him for the situation. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi is the body responsible for dealing with garbage. Illegal parking on roads, roadsides, and in market areas is another major issue in several sectors of the Rohini assembly constituency. “People park irresponsibly, and there is no check from the authorities. Sometimes, I also feel there are not enough spaces for cars in the area, but there should be a way out of this situation,\" said 25-year-old Gargi Chaddha, a resident of sector 18. She also highlighted the lack of public toilets in the locality. “Firstly, it is impossible to find a public toilet in the area, and if you manage to find one, it would not be in a condition to use,\" she added. Crime rate and law and order have also left the people worried. Chain and mobile phone snatching is a very common issue, according to several women who spoke with News18. Prashant Vihar seems to be one of the worst-impacted areas. Last month, the body of a 38-year-old man was found in a park in Prashant Vihar. In November and October 2024, two blasts were reported in the area – one outside a CRPF school and another near PVR Cinema. As per the data from the Election Commission of India, the seat has a total of 1.72 lakh voters – 83,397 women and 89,139 men. The seat falls under the north district of Delhi and has seen a total of 21 nominations of which 14 were accepted. The candidature of eight of these nominees had been finalised by Tuesday evening. Cakewalk for BJP? The Rohini assembly constituency, formed in 2008, is a part of the North West Delhi Lok Sabha seat. Except in 2013, when the Aam Aadmi Party got elected from the seat, the region has been a stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party . Vijender Gupta, who was elected from the seat in 2015 and 2020, is now aiming for a third term. The popularity of Gupta and the BJP could be understood from the fact that there were lanes in the assembly that were full of the party’s flags. Speaking with News18, Gupta said that the reality of AAP is now out there in the open and people are going to vote for the BJP. “The BJP is forming the government this time,\" he claimed.

(Representational photo/PTI) After close to three decades, the Bharatiya Janata Party smells an opportunity in the national capital, which will have elections early next month. The saffron party is putting together all its efforts to unseat the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi. With the motto of ending “aapda\" (crisis) rule in the capital, the saffron party has adopted an all-hands-on-deck approach. Not only are campaigns being carried out by BJP candidates and leaders, especially from Delhi, but the party has a more deep-rooted strategy. related stories Sources say that a team of 27 leaders has been constituted, which will be supervised by union home minister Amit Shah. Given his political acumen and proven track record as an organisation person, the saffron party is hopeful that this team will deliver the goods. This team, which consists of union ministers, party office-bearers, and members of Parliament, has been given a very specific assignment. The 27 include union ministers like Mansukh Mandaviya, Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, and Bhupender Yadav. BJP general secretaries Vinod Tawde and Sunil Bansal are also in it. Several MPs, including Vivek Thakur, Surendra Nagar, Arvind Dharmapuri, Biplab Deb, etc, are part of this panel. This team had a special meeting with Amit Shah a couple of days ago, and the brainstorming went on for more than four hours. The saffron party is extremely confident that its strategy of strengthening the booths will make all the difference in the upcoming elections . “We will be focusing on every booth across the capital. Since we have been able to win all the seats in Delhi in the Lok Sabha polls three times, a detailed study will be done on why the party is not able to convert the results of these booths in the assembly elections,\" a source aware of the developments told CNN-News18. Each of these leaders has been assigned two assembly constituencies where they will work over and above the task that has been handed to party leaders, star campaigners, and candidates themselves. “The job will be to ensure that the gap in the voters who voted for the BJP is closed in favour of the saffron party. There is no need for us to start campaigning aggressively or start delivering lectures or speeches. We will purely be doing much-needed work behind the scenes in each constituency,\" another source told CNN-News18. “Delhi is a confluence of many regions and cultures, and therefore, with the kind of bandwidth that the BJP has, we can bring in leaders from all parts of the country to come in for the management of elections. This is going to be extremely important since this will be an election for the BJP to win and AAP to lose.\" There are multiple things that a party or a candidate needs to focus on during elections, which takes away a lot of time from the contestant and the supporting personnel around him. This task will be outsourced to the 27 BJP members who will be in charge of the polls. “Realistically speaking, there are 51 seats that the party has identified that are viable and where there is a close contest between the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party or the Congress and BJP. Therefore, if the BJP is able to win these 51 seats, then the battle is pretty much over for the opposition,\" a source said. With less than two weeks to go for the high-profile elections in the national capital, this team of 27 will act as backroom boys to aid the candidates and the party in these constituencies. “The biggest advantage of having political leaders do the back-end work in a man-to-man marking situation remains that a political leader can be quick enough to find a political solution to an issue and can communicate effectively not just to the party leaders but also to the public concerned,\" a source said. This team of 27 will report to Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda directly on every issue of concern and also give them updates on the campaign, the way it is progressing on the ground, and whether the message that the saffron party is trying to send through its initiatives, announcements in the manifesto, and the concerns of the public reaches where they need to. Apart from the candidates and the local leaders, including members of Parliament from the national capital, the saffron party has deployed the services of 40 star campaigners for the Delhi election.

There is also a message in the song for the people of the national capital to pave the way for a better Delhi by rejecting the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the coming Assembly elections, he said. “The inspiration for the song came from the word AAP-da (disaster) used by Modi ji for the ruling AAP for its failure and mess created in Delhi under its ten-year rule in BJP’s Parivartan Rally recently held in Rohini,\" Bakshi added. The song says the people of Delhi have made up their minds to remove AAP and bring prosperity and happiness and the BJP to power in Delhi and have a “double engine\" government here.

(PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi, adopting a strategy of speaking on local issues with BJP workers regarding the Delhi election campaign, said people in the national capital are angry with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is getting nervous as polls near. PM Modi’s 80-minute-long message underlined the BJP’s strategy to expose the AAP on local issues of Delhi. He has given two big tasks to BJP’s workers — ensuring the highest turnout in their booth in the last decade, and achieving 50%-plus vote share for the BJP in every booth of Delhi. He said BJP’s workers must “expose the lies of AAP-Da\". related stories “Delhi’s people are sick of AAP’s lies, they have duped the people. They do new announcements daily because they hear news of defeat from various areas daily. People of Delhi have seen through AAP’s nervousness. AAP says ‘Phir Aayenge’ and people in the crowd say “Yeh Phir Khayenge (they will do more corruption),\" the prime minister said. The PM has also kept up his attack on AAP on the major issue of corruption, saying the focus of Arvind Kejriwal’s party was only on one thing – “Sheeshmahal Banao\". He said every Delhi resident remembers the lies of AAP when he or she sees Sheeshmahal. “It is a living symbol of corruption. Money was spent like water on Sheeshmahal,\" the prime minister said, alluding to a C&AG report. Modi said the people of AAP have no shame despite the Sheeshmahal and liquor scams. “No Delhi resident likes this and they are angry with AAP,\" the PM said. The prime minister said social activist Anna Hazare was also upset with Kejriwal as he established a party on the issue of Jan Lokpal, which does not exist in Delhi or Punjab where AAP has governments. “AAP showed CAG reports to expose the Congress’s corruption. Today, CAG reports exist but AAP is hiding them for the last four years as they are afraid of the truth and people knowing about their sins. We will table the CAG reports in assembly as soon as we come to power,\" he said. Modi added that Delhi should have an identity as national capital just like Bengaluru, Gurgaon, or Noida has. “AAP just blames others and does not do any work. We need double-engine government in Delhi,\" he said. Focus on Local Issues The PM said water and tanker mafia is operating in Delhi and people are forced to drink dirty water. He said AAP “hates people of Purvanchal as they made migrants leave Delhi during the Covid-19 pandemic\". The PM also said AAP does not want to adopt the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi “out of ego\" as they don’t care for the people of Delhi. He said BJP will give safe drinking water to people in Delhi through a mega campaign, like in other states. “Sharab toh milti hai, paani nahi milta hai,\" the prime minister said, referring to the condition of Delhi. He said AAP should have improved roads, sewers, build parks and parking spaces – but they did not fulfill any responsibility. He said AAP should also be exposed on the electricity bill issue as people’s bills have increased. The PM said BJP will clean the Yamuna like it had done with the Sabarmati riverfront and at the Kumbh. “AAP earlier said if they don’t clean Yamuna, then people should not vote for them. Show those videos.\" He said videos of AAP leaders’ earlier statements must be shown to people to expose their lies with proof. “We will improve Delhi’s government schools in the true sense with free education from KG to PG,\" the PM said. He said AAP promised to build houses, but did nothing. “But we have pictures of the houses built by BJP in Delhi, show them to the people,\" the PM said. BJP’s Promises The PM said the BJP’s promise of Rs 2,500 for women in Delhi will be fulfilled after the win in the national capital. “We are giving money under women’s scheme in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and other states. We fulfill our promises,\" he said. The prime minister said AAP is copying the Congress in making promises in Delhi but they have a government in Punjab where they fulfilled no promises like the Rs 1,000 per month to women. “People in Delhi don’t trust AAP’s promises, they have seen what happened in Himachal. AAP is two steps ahead of Congress, they have all the bad qualities of the Congress party. This is AAP-Da model which makes promises in the air. Women are my biggest suraksha-kavach,\" the prime minister said.

Their vote bank is the same, and many in the party, like Ajay Maken, feel that Congress should not have gone soft on Kejriwal even though he was part of the INDIA bloc. Many gave feedback that despite a public snubbing of Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury by Mallikarjun Kharge during the Bengal Lok Sabha polls to assuage Mamata Banerjee, she has not been soft on the Congress. In fact, the Trinamool Congress has led this call to make Mamata the face of the India bloc, citing the Congress’s poor poll performance as the reason why Congress cannot be the force to take on the Modi factor. This, along with the fact that many allies like the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, and TMC supported AAP in Delhi over the Congress, has made the Gandhis feel that other bloc members have not followed the coalition dharma, so why should the Congress alone be expected to follow suit? So, to adhere to its plan to make its presence felt in Delhi, a couple of steps will be taken. Like Ajay Maken, who was stopped from doing a tell-all exposé on Kejriwal earlier, will now do one. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will hit the streets. Rahul is expected to hold some meetings in Muslim-dominated areas and places where Dalits and OBCs are an important vote bank. Priyanka too is expected to campaign to capture women’s votes. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all But will the belated fight by the Congress help the BJP or hurt Kejriwal? The Congress, by its own admission, doesn’t seem confident of winning seats but hopes to increase its vote percentage in Delhi, where it has zero MPs and MLAs. For the Congress, this would be a start. As a senior Congress leader told News18, “Even if the BJP wins this time, next time we can. But more than this, defeat of AAP would mean Delhi will have only two players—Congress and BJP—and we will be back in the game.\" The Congress also hopes now that the loss of AAP in Delhi will make it easy for the party in Punjab as well. Hence the need to make the “dangal\" for Delhi a three-cornered fight. tags : aap congress delhi assembly election delhi election delhi elections Rahul Gandhi Location : New Delhi, India First Published: January 22, 2025, 06:00 IST News elections Congress Makes Late Push In Delhi Dangal; Here's Why Read More",

Written By : Aman Sharma News18.com Last Updated: January 20, 2025, 08:30 IST The women’s allowance scheme to be rolled out in Delhi, by whichever party wins these elections, will nearly double the city’s subsidy bill to Rs 22,000 crore every year reset Follow us on Google News The next 15 days will see people, and especially women, weigh the promises of AAP, BJP, and Congress and vote accordingly on February 5. (Representational image: News18) With 15 days to go before votes are cast, the Delhi elections have started a war of freebies. The Aam Aadmi Party, the BJP, and the Congress are going all out to woo the voters with financial benefits and subsidies. The Aam Aadmi Party is giving 200 units of free electricity and 20,000 litres of free water a month to domestic consumers, free bus rides for women, and has promised Rs 2,100 a month for women if it is in power again. It has also promised free electricity and water for those staying on rent. related stories The Congress has promised Rs 2,500 a month for women and 300 units of free power, but it is a small player in the Delhi polls. The big counter in fact has come from the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has promised Rs 2,500 to women every month and gas cylinders at Rs 500. The party is also expected to announce certain units of free power and free water. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that no existing public welfare scheme in Delhi will be stopped. Freebies have determined the outcome of the Delhi elections in a big way, both in 2015 and 2020, when AAP won with massive mandates on the back of its sops. But this time, the BJP is posing a strong challenge with counter-freebies. The big question is, who will the people of Delhi believe in now? We will come to that just in a bit. First, let us look at the burden of the freebies on the exchequer. An estimated Rs 11,000 crore is spent on subsidies in Delhi every year, like free electricity, free water, and free bus rides for women. The women’s allowance scheme to be rolled out in Delhi, by whichever party wins these elections, will nearly double the city’s subsidy bill to Rs 22,000 crore every year. Delhi has for long not been a revenue-deficit state but is poised to become one given the rising freebie bill. But Delhi is not the only region that is getting weighed down under the rising bill of monthly payouts to women, which is becoming a standard poll promise across India. Let’s talk about some history. It all started in West Bengal in 2021, when Mamata Banerjee first brought the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme for women. Presently, Rs 1,000-Rs 1,200 per month is given to women under it. The scheme has had a deep impact on the Trinamool Congress’s poll successes in West Bengal. The Congress took a leaf out of Mamata Banerjee’s book to promise Rs 1,500 per month for women during the 2022 Himachal Pradesh elections and won the state. In 2023, the BJP jumped onto the bandwagon with the then chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, rolling out the Ladli Behna Yojana, under which Rs 1,250 per month is given to women. This scheme was seen as a major reason for the BJP’s thumping win in Madhya Pradesh. In the same year, the Gruha Lakshmi scheme was launched by the Congress government in Karnataka with a monthly assistance of Rs 2,000 for women, again a promise that brought it to power in the elections. 2024 saw a flurry of states launch similar schemes. Chhattisgarh rolled out the Mahtari Vandana Yojana with Rs 1,000 per month for women after a poll promise by the BJP that gave it a win. The Congress promised the Maha Lakshmi Scheme with Rs 2,500 a month for women in the Telangana elections and won the state. The JMM government in Jharkhand started the Maiya Samman Yojana in 2024 before the elections, offering Rs 1,000 monthly assistance to women, and was victorious. Finally, the BJP in Maharashtra rolled out its women scheme at Rs 1,500 per month and won the recent elections with a huge majority. So all parties have realised the winning mantra—a monetary scheme for women, as they are a major vote bank. Now, the big question: whose promises will work in Delhi? In past elections, what has been seen is that the first-mover advantage is key when it comes to offering women’s schemes. Whichever party can give the money first gets the pole position, compared to the party promising it. That means the incumbent party invariably has an advantage. We have seen this both in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, where the BJP government sent some instalments of the money to the bank accounts of women before elections and won the polls as women trusted that party more whose government was already giving the money. In rural areas of the country where women have invariably been dependent on the men in the family for money to run the household, the money coming directly into their bank accounts is a major empowering tool that gives them...",

(Image: PTI) Ever since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced its two candidate lists for Delhi Assembly Election, there has been growing discontent and dissent within the ranks of the party over candidate selection. In fact, things went so bad that the BJP had to release a third list consisting of a single name after the said candidate – Mohan Singh Bisht – openly rebelled against the party leadership. From shouting slogans to accusing BJP leaders of being unaware of the ground situation, dissent overflowed, costing embarrassment to the party that takes pride in keeping its cadres disciplined. related stories PROTESTS OVER TUGHLAKABAD, KARAWAL NAGAR CANDIDATES One of the main seats where dissent was noticed was Tughlakabad — a seat Ramesh Bidhuri represented for three terms as MLA since 2008. BJP’s second list was released on Saturday. In this, the names of 29 candidates were announced. In this list, Rohtas Bidhuri has been fielded from the Tughlakabad seat. However, in the 2020 assembly elections, Vikram Bidhuri — Ramesh Bidhuri’s relative — contested this seat and he lost to Sahiram of Aam Aadmi Party by more than 13,000 votes, which is the reason he is not being given a ticket this time from Tughlakabad. But that did not stop his supporters from agitating. Protestors from Tughlakabad in South Delhi reached the Delhi BJP office and staged a protest at the gate. The protesting workers demanded a change of candidate for this seat. The matter did not stop at that. In highly dramatised optics that were bound to serve the AAP, angry protesters also raised slogans of “ Modi tujhse bair nahi, Rohtas teri khair nahi (We have no discontent with you, Modi, but, Rohtas, you won’t be spared)\". Afraid of an inside hit job at Rohtas Bidhuri, the current BJP candidate from Tughlakabad, the BJP tried not to take the disciplinary route and instead reached out to them saying, the party will ensure Rohtas will take everyone along once he wins, said sources. But this did not stop at pro-Vikram Bidhuri slogans. The BJP fielded former AAP minister Kapil Mishra from Karawal Nagar, disregarding the five-time MLA Bisht, forcing Bisht to turn rebel. Bisht — an Uttarakhandi and Rajput face – played the victim card. He openly criticised the BJP leadership and called fielding Mishra, whom he called “aire gaire natthu khaire\", a “big mistake\". “The BJP thinks they will field anyone and he will win. This is a big mistake. Only time will tell what will happen in Burari, Karawal Nagar, Ghonda, Seelampur, Gokalpuri, and Nand Nagri seats,\" he threatened, forcing the BJP to open an overnight communication channel with him to assure Bisht that a third list bearing only his name would be put out. This is exactly what happened as BJP’s third list, bearing only his name, was released announcing he would be contesting from Mustafabad. MEHRAULI, MADIPUR & MORE This is not the first time dissent oozed out during the run-up to Delhi election. After the list of candidates was released, the Delhi BJP office witnessed protests like those the party office witnessed by the pro-Vikram Bidhuri faction. Even after the release of BJP’s first list, a similar protest was carried out by some party workers outside the Delhi BJP office against Mehrauli candidate Gajendra Yadav. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Protests were witnessed in Kondli and Madipur as well. In these two constituencies, the BJP feels, protests are being engineered by the party’s “upset\" Dalit ticket aspirants “who believe they have been deliberately denied\", said a BJP functionary. Both these seats are reserved seats, and the BJP has fielded women candidates from both places. The saffron party has fielded Urmila Kailash Gangwar from Madipur and Priyanka Gautam from Kondli. Party sources say, the BJP, unlike other constituencies, have not been entirely successful in convincing the upset members of SC Morcha who were steering the protests in both these places. tags : aap BJP delhi elections Location : New Delhi, India First Published: January 16, 2025, 11:27 IST News elections From Tughlakabad To Kondli, Dissent Plagues Delhi BJP Over Candidate Selection For Polls Read More",

(News18/PTI File) The unreleased reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) will be the ‘kaal’ (doom) for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal, just like it shook the Congress-led UPA-II and brought down the two-term government of the late Dr Manmohan Singh, said Vijender Gupta, Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) leader of opposition in the Delhi assembly. Speaking to News18, the two-time Rohini MLA also said that the AAP is suppressing the CAG reports as they are aware that it contains blunders, corruption, leakages and misuse of public funds. related stories “The leaked report has hints of all these things. In the past five years, not a single CAG report has been tabled in the assembly. These reports contain reality on pollution, health and education. These reports are the audit of public money that shows blunders. They are holding up these reports as they know otherwise their reality would be made public through these reports. This is complete lawlessness,\" Gupta said ahead of filing his nominations on Wednesday. He went on to say that the reports from CAG authenticate the corruption of Kejriwal and his party under their rule. “The CAG reports brought down the government of the late Manmohan Singh. All those scams, including 2G, came out in public due to the reports from CAG. These reports (on Delhi) will be the ‘kaal’ of Kejriwal too,\" he said in Hindi. THE CAG REPORTS The CAG is the supreme audit institution of India. The body is empowered to audit all receipts and expenditure of the Union and State Governments and various bodies under them. The audit reports from CAG come into the public domain after they are tabled in the Parliament or the concerned state legislature. However, the CAG reports on the Delhi government were leaked before it was tabled. The leaked reports show some irregularities. The BJP MLAs, including Gupta, have been demanding the tabling of these reports for a long time now and eventually moved court for the same. On Monday, the Delhi High Court questioned the Delhi government over the delay in the tabling of these reports saying it “raises doubts about your bona fides\". The next hearing in this case is on January 16. Gupta went on to say that they did everything in their hands to table these reports in the assembly but the AAP blocked them everywhere. “We were marshalled out of the assembly for demanding the tabling of these reports. They don’t want to bring these reports to the assembly because they are hiding the truth. Now our only hope is court. We are hopeful that the court will give directions to table these reports,\" he said. The outgoing LoP explained that a session should be called before the elections are held. “The house is still live and can be called even now. The house should be called and these reports should be tabled and made public. This has nothing to do with elections,\" he said. Another case was filed in the Delhi High Court saying that at least 14 CAG reports are pending and should be tabled before elections are held on February 5. On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court asked the CAG to explain why the reports could not be made public. The next hearing will be held on January 24. WHAT SANJAY SINGH HAD SAID Earlier this month, when parts of the CAG reports were leaked, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said the BJP was using forged documents to push its narrative. “The CAG report comes in a sealed cover and has not yet been tabled. Meanwhile, the BJP is using forged documents to push its narrative,\" he had said, raising counter questions for the BJP governments in several states not publishing these reports. जय श्री राम।श्री मनोहर लाल खट्टर जी और रोहिणी की जनता के आशीर्वाद के साथ, नामांकन दाखिल हेतु प्रस्थान। pic.twitter.com/gl3sl1c1Dk — Vijender Gupta (@Gupta_vijender) January 15, 2025 POLL PROSPECTS Gupta, who filed his nomination from the Rohini assembly seat aiming for a third term, went on to say that they will form the government with a complete majority. “People had enough of them (AAP). They are exposed now. The narrative they gave on honesty had been broken. This was their USP (unique selling proposition) but now people are not trusting them. We are forming the government with a complete majority,\" he added. Gupta went on to say that in the past 10 years, the AAP destroyed the city.

The development comes even as Kejriwal announced that he would file his nomination papers from the New Delhi Vidhan Sabha seat on Wednesday. Why is the prosecution sanction important? related stories The missing prosecution sanction had been cited by the AAP supremo to challenge the PMLA court’s decision to take cognizance of the charge sheet against Kejriwal, Sisodia, and others.

While the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had received sanction to prosecute Kejriwal under Prevention of Corruption Act, ED moved for a separate sanction under Section 197(1) of CRPC as mandated by a Supreme Court order. How will this impact polls? The special court could take up the matter on January 30, just five days ahead of polls in Delhi. ED is likely to push for framing of charges after presenting the requisite documents. Once the charges are framed, the trial against Kejriwal and Sisodia will begin. Kejriwal was granted bail by the Supreme Court in September last year. Sisodia had been granted bail a month earlier and delayed trial was one of the grounds the apex court considered before giving relief. Now, if trial begins, the BJP will up the ante against AAP in the last leg of campaigning. Legally too, it might be difficult for Kejriwal to return as chief minister while the trial is on. His bail conditions had forced him to step down from the CM’s chair since he was barred from visiting the secretariat or CMO. He was also restricted from signing any files.

Pawar said the INDIA bloc was formed only for national-level elections and nothing was discussed about contesting municipal or state polls together. related stories “When the INDIA bloc was formed, the discussion was only about national issues and elections. No discussion was held regarding local body polls or state polls,\" Pawar said while addressing the media. However, Pawar also stated that a meeting would be held among the MVA constituents to decide if the parties should go ahead with contesting the civic polls alone or stay in the alliance and fight together. “The decision regarding the upcoming municipal elections in Maharashtra will be taken after holding a meeting in 8–10 days whether we will fight together or alone. We have communication within the alliance,\" he added. Pawar’s remark comes days after the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) announced that it would contest the elections to the local bodies, including the one for the coveted Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), alone. Uddhav Sena To Go Solo The Shiv Sena (UBT) on Saturday confirmed that the party will contest local body elections alone. Announcing the decision, senior party leader Sanjay Raut said that there will be no alliance with the opposition coalition, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), for local elections. “Right from Mumbai to Nagpur, we will fight the elections (local self-government) on our own strength. We want to see what happens,\" Raut said.

There is no meeting of the alliance. There is no chairman of the alliance.\" “Shiv Sena (UBT) will contest the Mumbai and Nagpur Municipal Corporation elections on its own because it is the demand of the workers… If they (Congress) had helped AAP, BJP’s victory would have been stopped. The fight is between AAP and BJP, but now Congress will cut AAP’s votes. Congress party should introspect,\" he added. Test For INDIA Bloc The INDIA bloc alliance is set to witness a tough test since its allies Congress and AAP are contesting the Delhi polls alone against each other. It is important to note that the elections in the national capital will prove to be a testing time for the opposition alliance as its allies like Samajwadi Party and Trinamool Congress have extended their support to Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP ahead of the polls in the capital, scheduled to take place on February 5. Pawar has also snubbed Congress and asserted that his party would support Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi elections. “In Delhi Assembly elections, my feeling is that we should help Arvind Kejriwal,\" the former Maharashtra Chief Minister said. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all tags : maharashtra Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 14, 2025, 16:16 IST News elections INDIA Bloc Cracking?

Last month also, the AAP raised similar allegations against Congress when they attacked Dikshit and Maken for filing official complaints against the AAP over a range of issues. “Congress is fielding candidates whose sole purpose is to harm the Aam Aadmi Party.

(PTI file for representation only) Here’s the curious case of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) third list — it bore only one name, that of Mohan Singh Bisht , the party’s sitting MLA from Karawal Nagar, contesting from Mustafabad. The BJP fielded former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) minister Kapil Mishra from Karawal Nagar, disregarding the five-time MLA Bisht, forcing Bisht to turn into a rebel.

They cite at least three reasons why Bisht has a better winning chance than his competitors. “ The BJP fights to win,\" said a BJP functionary at party headquarters. One, while there is no denying that Mustafabad has 40% Muslim voters, it also has 60% Hindu voters, says the BJP functionary. While the 40% Muslim voters will get divided among three Muslim candidates of the AAP, Congress and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Bisht is set to capitalise on the entire Hindu vote, he insists. Two, Owaisi’s AIMIM making undertrial former AAP leader Tahir Hussain its Mustafabad candidate will polarise the election in Mustafabad, the BJP hopes. Hussain is an undertrial prisoner in a Delhi riots case. #DelhiElections2025 : On Kapil Mishra fielded from Karawal Nagar seat, sitting BJP MLA Mohan Singh Bisht says, \"The BJP thinks they will field anyone and he will win.

So gelling back will not take a long time, hopes the party. “I have been an MLA from 1998 to 2008 in Karawal Nagar when Mustafabad assembly constituency was being created. People are coming out in my support here,\" Bisht said, expressing hope of winning Mustafabad for the BJP, leaving the animosity behind. Multiple sources confirmed to News18 that while the BJP’s chance of winning from Mustafabad remains high even after it being a Muslim-dominated seat. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The fact that the party had to yield to Bisht’s tantrums shows two things — his clean image and acceptability in Karawal Nagar, from where he has been sent packing and a fear of caste backlash from Uttarakhandis and Rajputs. So far, Bisht is the only Uttarakhandi in the Delhi BJP list, while he also hails from the Rajput community. And the BJP not giving him a chance even in Mustafabad could have been counterproductive for the saffron party. tags : delhi election delhi elections news18 specials Location : New Delhi, India First Published: January 14, 2025, 13:06 IST News elections Delhi Polls: 3 Reasons Why BJP Is Confident Of Win In Mustafabad Which Has 40% Muslim Voters Read More",

Till I am alive, whenever an Indian will be assaulted, be it a Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian, that person may be of any caste, you will find Rahul Gandhi protecting that person,\" the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha said addressing his ‘Jai Bapu, Jai Bhim, Jai Samvidhan’ public meeting in Seelampur here. “This is what India means to me, a country where there is no hatred and the poorest of the poor, be it of any religion or caste, can dream big,\" he said. Gandhi said the Congress would not let “billionaires like Adani and Ambani control everything while the poor keep suffering\". “We do not want such an India and we won’t let it happen,\" he said and asked whether Kejriwal and Modi had ever said a word against big businessmen. Training his guns at Kejriwal, Gandhi recalled that the AAP chief had said that he would clean Delhi, remove corruption, and turn the national capital into Paris. “What actually happened — one cannot move around due to pollution and inflation is rising,\" the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha said. “Arvind Kejriwal had talked of removing corruption. Has he removed corruption? Just like Modi ji’s propaganda through the media, making false promises one after another, he (Kejriwal) is following the same strategy. There is no difference at all,\" Gandhi said. Taking to X, Kejriwal said Rahul Gandhi “abused\" him a lot but he will not comment on the Congress leader’s statements. “His fight is to save Congress, my fight is to save the country,\" the AAP chief said. The Congress and AAP are part of the INDIA bloc. The two parties had fought the Lok Sabha election together in Delhi, but are contesting the assembly polls separately. Stressing that India belongs to everyone, Gandhi said the Congress does not want “an India run by a handful of crony capitalists\". He said a look at the list of top 500 companies will show that “not even one is headed by any backward, Dalit, tribal or minority\" community member. “When I talk of caste census, neither Modi says a word nor does Kejriwal because both want that backward sections, Dalits, tribals and minorities do not get their due share (bhagidari). Ask Kejriwal whether he is with the caste census. Ask Modi ji whether he is with the caste census,\" Gandhi said. “I had said to Modi ji in Parliament that whether you do it or not, we will get the caste census done and reservation cap removed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha when a Congress government comes. “We want equality, we want the poorest of the poor, whether they are Dalits, backwards, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Christians, to dream big. I want to see a day when Dalits, backwards and minorities head companies that are in the top 500,\" he said. “The truth is that long speeches will be given by Kejriwal and Modi but when it comes to giving the rightful share only the Congress can give that,\" he said citing the examples of RTI, land acquisition, Right to food and MGNREGS. He urged the people to support the Congress and make it victorious, asserting that the party would ensure Delhi’s development as in the past under Sheila Dikshit’s government. “Neither Kejriwal nor the BJP can do what the Congress had done,\" Gandhi said.

(Image: @INCIndia/X) In the nearly 25 minutes that senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi spoke on Monday at his first rally for the upcoming Delhi assembly elections, he mentioned AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal four times. But, missing in his speech were references to the ‘Sheesh Mahal’ row and the CAG report on the now-scrapped liquor policy. As he launched his poll campaign, his attack was more focused on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the RSS. He accused the BJP-led central government of compromising the Constitution and also blamed it for running a monopoly of the corporates. related stories Nothing new here, but just that, for the Delhi elections, when most of the Congress leaders were sharing stage with him, they were, perhaps, hoping more of an attack against the AAP. Present among other party leaders were also those who are contesting the polls, including Sandeep Dikshit, who is up against Kejriwal. Delhi Congress leaders were caught by surprise, having prepared themselves for an aggressive battle against Kejriwal and reclaim what was once a strong ground for them. They were assured by the top leadership that Gandhi and the party will come on strong. Calling his first rally the ‘Jai Bhim, Samvidhan Bachao’ rally, Gandhi’s indication was clear – that his speech will focus more on the BJP and RSS and little on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). His speech came on a day when the high court rapped the Delhi government for “dragging its feet\" over calling an assembly session to table the CAG report on the excise policy. ALSO READ | AAP Will Face Voter Backlash In Delhi For Suppressing CAG Reports, Says Hardeep Singh Puri In a conversation with News18 , Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri raised questions on what the AAP government has to hide, seeing as they were not allowing an assembly session to be called. Gandhi’s silence on the ‘Sheesh Mahal’ controversy and the CAG reports left his party disappointed. All the more because it was first a complaint by the Congress that shone a light on the alleged liquor policy scam. In fact, the BJP is hopeful that the Congress will gear up because that will help them politically and divide the “anti-BJP camp\" again. “The congress must understand that if it fails to fight the AAP, it will meet the same fate as it did in Maharashtra and many other states,\" Puri said. The Gandhis, however, believe that keeping the BJP away is more important even if it means that Kejriwal gets another term in Delhi at the cost of the Congress. It was clear from Rahul’s Seelampur rally that for him the  bigger enemy is the RSS and BJP. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all He rounded up his speech by saying he will keep attacking the RSS and BJP till his last breath. But, on some occasions, he did mention that like the BJP and the Prime Minister, Kejriwal, too, had failed to fulfil his promise to the people of the city. In Sandeep Dikshit’s presence, Rahul made the point that former CM Sheila Dikshit’s Delhi had been compromised and ruined by Kejriwal. But, he also attacked Kejriwal over the caste census issue, making it clear that this and the Constitution issue were more important for him. Whereas, for the Congress leaders contesting the polls, highlighting the AAP government’s alleged corruption would have been a wiser move. tags : aam aadmi party arvind kejriwal delhi election Rahul Gandhi Location : New Delhi, India First Published: January 13, 2025, 23:00 IST News elections Delhi Polls: Rahul Gandhi's First Campaign Speech Focuses More On RSS-BJP, Less On AAP Read More",

After the Sheesh Mahal issue, the BJP’s arsenal against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the Delhi election campaign on the issue of corruption has got another boost with a C&AG report pegging the loss caused by the Delhi liquor scam at Rs 2,026 crore. The BJP is making corruption and the lack of probity in public life the centerpiece of its poll campaign this time, sensing the AAP is on a weak ground on the same. related stories This makes the 2025 Delhi election very different from the 2020 or the 2015 elections in the national capital. Then, AAP had cashed in on its image of being a ‘Kattar Imaandaar’ (honest) party and its leader Arvind Kejriwal working on the principle of ‘simple living and high thinking’. The liquor scam and Sheesh Mahal controversy is questioning both these USPs of AAP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also said to have asked BJP leaders to ‘expose’ AAP and Kejriwal on the issue of corruption in Delhi and make more efforts in this regard. BJP leader Anurag Thakur has said there would be no other party whose eight ministers, various MLAs, and the then chief minister and deputy chief minister had to go to jail. In many ways, the BJP is trying to repeat in the Delhi assembly elections against AAP what it successfully did against the Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections — that the incumbent government is rocked by corruption scams and people should vote on this issue. This strategy also is to take the focus away from AAP’s freebies that have worked for Kejriwal’s party in the last two elections. The prime minister has assured Delhi’s voters that no existing schemes running in public interest will be stopped if BJP comes to power. Top BJP leaders feel the sheen of Kejriwal is gone this time, with serious charges of corruption and scams against him, due to which Kejriwal and senior AAP leaders like Manish Sisodia had to go to jail. To double down on this issue, the party first raised the ‘Sheesh Mahal’ issue, pointing to a C&AG report that pegged the renovation cost of the chief minister’s residence at Rs 33.6 crore. Now, the new revelations about the monetary loss caused by the liquor scam are giving the BJP more ammunition against AAP. Remember, this is the same case in which top AAP leaders were jailed. While Kejriwal and Sisodia always claimed that not even a single penny was recovered regarding the alleged scam, the C&AG report is — for the first time — putting a figure to the said scam at Rs 2,026 crore. One can expect top BJP leaders led by PM Modi to raise this ‘loss figure of Rs 2026 crore’ strongly during the Delhi election campaign that begins in full flow this week. BJP president JP Nadda has termed this the ‘AAP-DA’ [catastrophe] model of loot in full display and claimed that it is just a matter of a few weeks before AAP is voted out and punished for their misdeeds. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The Aam Aadmi Party’s strategy seems to be terming the C&AG reports as a BJP ploy during elections and the party is playing them down, claiming their top leaders were jailed under false charges. The bail granted to Kejriwal or Sisodia were celebrated by the AAP as big victories. But the BJP here is trying to tell the voters that coming out on bail does not mean any clean chit and the court trial will go on. It is reminding voters that both C&AG reports, into Sheesh Mahal and the liquor scam, are proof that AAP leaders are not above board. tags : Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) AAP vs BJP delhi elections Location : New Delhi, India First Published: January 12, 2025, 09:26 IST News elections First Sheesh Mahal, Now Rs 2,026 Crore Liquor Scam Loss: BJP Banks On ‘Corruption’ Plank in Delhi Elections Read More",

(PTI) In the aftermath of the Maharashtra assembly elections, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) faction has shifted its focus to the crucial Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections . While the assembly results saw the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, which includes Sena UBT, Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar) and Congress, suffer a major defeat, Thackeray is determined to leave the past behind and reclaim the Sena’s stronghold in Mumbai. related stories A growing sentiment among party leaders and grassroots workers is that the Shiv Sena UBT should contest the BMC elections independently, breaking away from the MVA, particularly the Congress, to preserve its identity and assert its strength. Over the past month, Thackeray has been conducting detailed reviews of the party’s organisational structure across Mumbai. He has held multiple meetings with branch heads, sub-divisional leaders, and assembly organisers to assess the party’s readiness. Feedback collected by party observers, who were deployed to monitor the city’s constituencies, highlights a clear demand for contesting the elections on the party’s own terms. Many believe the friction between the Congress and Sena UBT during the assembly polls over seat-sharing left a sour taste, prompting workers to advocate for a standalone approach. Thackeray’s rigorous reviews include a ward-wise analysis of voter sentiments and the party’s strength. Meetings held at Matoshree have revealed a strong push from local leaders to fight independently. They argue that an alliance risks diluting the Sena’s core identity, which has been synonymous with Mumbai’s political landscape for decades. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Despite this growing consensus, the final decision lies with Thackeray, who is carefully weighing all options. He is set to conclude reviews of six south Mumbai constituencies, a critical step towards finalising the party’s strategy, on Friday. As the battle for Mumbai’s civic body intensifies, all major parties are gearing up for what promises to be a high-stakes election. For the Shiv Sena (UBT) , the BMC elections are not just about political power, but also about reasserting the party’s dominance in the city. Whether the decision is to go solo or remain part of the alliance, the Shiv Sena under Uddhav Thackeray is preparing to fight with full force, determined to make its mark in what is being seen as a defining moment for the party’s future. tags : BMC BMC elections news18 specials Shiv Sena UBT uddhav thackeray Location : Mumbai, India First Published: January 10, 2025, 14:56 IST News elections Uddhav Thackeray Begins Preparations For Mumbai Civic Body Polls, Cadre Wants Sena UBT To Go Solo Read More",

Reported By : Anindya Banerjee News18.com Last Updated: January 10, 2025, 12:40 IST The BJP has an explosive CAG report that demolishes Arvind Kejriwal’s “aam aadmi” image over alleged splurging over his residence, which they have dubbed as “Sheesh Mahal” reset Follow us on Google News Delhi elections: A young supporter holds a caricature of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a rally in Rohini area on January 5. (PTI) The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) manifesto committee is brainstorming over what promises to make to the people of Delhi. The party has an explosive CAG report that demolishes Arvind Kejriwal’s “aam aadmi\" image over alleged splurging over his residence, which they have dubbed as “Sheesh Mahal\" . The BJP’s biggest vote-catcher, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also launched a scathing attack on the ruling AAP calling it “AAP-da\" or calamity. related stories The BJP has all it takes to win the Delhi elections on February 5, along with the fact the AAP has been in power for a really long time, which should go against it. Yet, questions remain. There’s a reason behind it. PM MODI, AAP-DA, SHEESH MAHAL: THE PERFECT MIX The manifesto committee has been flirting with the idea of announcing a woman’s scheme giving them Rs 2,500 each month — an amount the Congress has promised. However, sources in the BJP say many want the leadership to cross the Rs 2,500-mark and have an edge over both the Congress and AAP. However, the decision is pending, they say. News18 has learnt that the BJP may announce free electricity of up to 300 units and free piped water to Delhi residents in its ‘Sankalp Patra’ which will be released soon. Taking a leaf out of AAP’s book, the BJP is learnt to be planning to provide free electricity of up to 500 units to religious places such as temples and gurdwaras. The BJP has meticulously used the leaked CAG report to hit where it hurts the most — Kejriwal’s brand image which took years to build. An image of a commoner, who is from the working class, joined politics to change the polity of the country has been ruthlessly demolished by the BJP through consecutive press conferences and posting of videos, so much so that ‘Sheesh Mahal’ started to trend on X. PM Modi led the attack, “You will be pained to know that when people were fighting Covid, running around to get medicines and oxygen, their (AAP’s) entire focus was on making Sheesh Mahal.\" The alleged corruption of the AAP leaders is now an election issue with the PM calling the party top brass “kattar beiman\". The AAP has been in power in Delhi since 2013, with a break. The anti-incumbency and unrealised promises such as tap water and clean Yamuna should be easy for the BJP to exploit. Also, what should help the BJP more is campaigning by PM Narendra Modi — a vote-catcher, a man who India listens to. He recently said, “Jabse maine aapda ka kaccha chittha khola hai, tabse ye aapda wale tilmila gaye hain ye log (since I started exposing these people, they have been in a panic).\" All in all, come February 8, the BJP has enough reason to be confident. But it’s easier said than done. WHY BJP CAN’T BE FULLY CONFIDENT The last time the BJP had a CM face in Delhi was 2015, when they brought Kiran Bedi. The BJP faced defeat, and Bedi, too, lost from Krishna Nagar. Ever since the party stopped experimenting with the CM face and has resorted to Narendra Modi’s face — a trend emulated in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh elections not so long ago. But Arvind Kejriwal, regardless of what the BJP might think, has nearly served a decade as the Chief Minister and that registers well with the voters. In the 2020 polls, the BJP’s vote share was 38.51 per cent, while that of the AAP was 53.57 per cent. The massive gap of 15 per cent meant the BJP won just eight seats out of 70, ensuring an AAP sweep with 62 seats. Bridging this gap will not just be a tough call for the BJP, but for any political opponent. Despite the BJP’s mega outreach programme to AAP’s two core voter bases — auto drivers and slum dwellers — insiders say they continue to prefer the AAP. Initially, the idea was to swing 30-40 per cent of Delhi’s 93,000 auto drivers towards the BJP to help increase its vote share. But now, insiders say, that doesn’t seem to be happening. Similarly, PM Modi may have tried to reach out by handing out 1,645 flats to poor slum dwellers, but that mood does not seem to reflect in other slums where there have been no beneficiaries. “What makes our job tough is the cosmopolitan nature of Delhi and the unique way they vote. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, these very voters en masse voted for the BJP, giving us seven out of seven MPs. Then came the 2020 assembly elections and they voted for the AAP. It’s not about slums or posh areas — Delhi voters are transactional. So we have to sell a different BJP for the Lok Sabha polls and another for assembly, both customised to their needs,\" a B...",

(X) While Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will provide free treatment to senior citizens in the national capital even in private hospitals if it is re-elected, the ultimate aim is to cover each individual from birth under a similar setup, Satyendar Jain, former health minister and the creator of mohalla clinics, told News18. The leader said the party and the government will not consider itself successful until quality education and healthcare are provided to all. In case of education, Jain said the aim is to bring at least 80% students in Delhi to public schools. related stories Jain shared that so far at least three lakh students in Delhi have moved to government schools from private schools as the quality of education has improved. This number, he assured, will go up further if the AAP is re-elected in 2025. “We want to give every citizen of Delhi quality education and quality healthcare… You will see how a big share of students will move from private to public schools in the near future. We want all students in Delhi, or at least 80 per cent of them, to study in government schools. Similar wish is for healthcare,\" he said. Jain said maximum people in Delhi should use government healthcare and until the AAP and its government achieve this, they will not consider themselves successful. Delhi will go to polls on February 5 and the results will be announced on February 8. ‘WHY NO FREE HEALTHCARE FOR THOSE ABOVE POVERTY LINE?’ Speaking about the AAP’s poll promise of free healthcare for elders above the age of 60, Jain said this will eventually cover each and every citizen without any eligibility or class division. “Be it Rs 1 lakh or Rs 1 crore, the treatment in public and private hospitals will be free for senior citizens. This is the first stage. We will consider ourselves successful only if we provide this scheme to each and every individual without any economic or class divide,\" he assured, adding, “It will eventually cover 100 per cent population in Delhi.\" Slamming the political parties and past governments in India, he said they have drawn a line called the poverty line. “All schemes are for those below the poverty line. Why will you not cover those who are above the poverty line in the healthcare scheme? They are the ones who are paying taxes. But the governments say that because they can afford the cost of treatment, they will not be covered. They first pay the taxes and then pay for their healthcare too,\" Jain said. इस बार आम आदमी पार्टी को वोट देने की वजह…5 फरवरी का दिन होगाझाड़ू चुनाव चिन्ह होगा #PhirLayengeKejriwal #DelhiElection2025 pic.twitter.com/6alVdLonsi — Satyendar Jain (@SatyendarJain) January 8, 2025 ‘WANT TAXPAYERS TO SEND KIDS TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS’ Speaking about education, he said the middle class pays the taxes, but the quality of education so far was so bad that their children could not enrol in those schools. “Why were public schools bad? Those who are actually paying for these schemes and schools are not able to benefit from them. We will consider ourselves successful only when the taxpayers will send their students to public schools. Our target is to cover all the health expenses from the day a child is born,\" Jain added. Now the question, he further said, will be why it took so long to achieve all this. Explaining this, Jain said climbing a high-rise building takes time and first the initial floors have to be climbed. “So far, the situation was so bad that everything and everyone was in the basement. Now we have managed to get to the middle floors. You can’t go to the 10th floor directly. I can assure our target and direction are right,\" he said. Jain is contesting for the fourth time from Shakur Basti. While the candidate from the Congress has been announced, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to announce its candidate against Jain. Reacting to this, he said: “The public doesn’t vote for the BJP based on the candidate. They may not even know who the candidate was. The BJP doesn’t have any issue or narrative.\" ‘WELL-WISHERS TOLD ME TO QUIT POLITICS’ Speaking about the case he is facing and his almost two-year-long prison stay, Jain said people are saying he should not have been sent to jail. “ Politics has its own place and should be done for a few months (around the elections). Post that, we are all citizens of this country. The aim should be to perform better than others and not stop others from working,\" Jain said. About his case and the pressure, he said those who switched sides to the BJP are not facing any cases or charges. But those who refused, en...",

First-time MP from Wayanad, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra spoke in the meeting asking for an explanation on how expenses will be cut down with the new legislation. She argued that the figures discussed by the government in its presentation made a reference to the parliamentary committee findings before 2004, while the electronic voting machine (EVM) was introduced only after this year, which meant that expenses were reduced.

Over 80 per cent people surveyed believe that having fewer elections can ease daily life with lesser disruptions. It has been observed that every time elections take place, rallies lead to traffic woes for locals, and schools and offices are shut for a couple of days for polling.

According to a News18 Pulse survey, nearly 50 per cent respondents expressed confidence that there would be no confusion. As per the survey, 49.4 per cent of the respondents feel that voters will not face problems in differentiating between candidates and parties at national and state levels, compared to 39.1 per cent feeling otherwise. More respondents in south (46 per cent) and west (46.6 per cent) think that voters will face problems in differentiating between candidates and parties at national and state levels. Even among respondents who support the ONOE proposal, about a third, or 33.6 per cent of respondents feel that voters will face problems in differentiating between candidates and parties at national and state levels. However, 55.9 per cent respondents in central India, 62 per cent in east, 52 per cent in north and 44.7 per cent in northeast say that confusion over local and national candidates will not prevail when ONOE comes into effect.

Singh and Modi, though divided by political spectrum and ideology, seem to be united by their belief in simple living. A latest query by RTI activist Prafful Sarda enquired about the cost for the “Deepavali Festival\" from 2014 to 2024 — the last 10 years of PM Modi’s rule — and 2004 to 2013 — 10 years of Manmohan Singh’s rule who passed away recently.

But here we have two men — a sitting PM and a former PM — leading terms of 10 years with such example,\" Sarda told News18.

All 13,033 polling stations in Delhi are urban, and it has been a massive challenge for the Election Commission of India (ECI) to get urban voters to booths despite all its efforts in other cities. It also happens to be a single-phase election as all 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi go to polls on the same day. related stories The EC started using mid-week polling as a means to discourage voters from planning mini-breaks and weekend getaways, so as to fight urban apathy towards voting. This was first attempted in March 2023 when the dates for the Karnataka polls were announced. Although there was not much improvement in the urban voter turnout, there was still a slight increase at 55 per cent from 54.6 per cent in 2018.

The consequences were that parts of Gurugram and Faridabad witnessed poor voter turnout, with some booths registering only 20 per cent. This means for every 100 voters, only 20 came out to vote. But, when Maharashtra went to polls in November 2024, voting took place on November 20, again a Wednesday. It worked well and the voter turnout improved by close to six percentage points from 2019 to 56 per cent in Mumbai, despite the city reporting the lowest participation in the state. In Lok Sabha, this could not be practiced and the impact was seen across cities. The first two phases were conducted on a Friday and, both times, the voter turnout was lower than in 2019, except for some constituencies.

(File images) Even before the Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday announced February 5 as the date for bypoll in Ayodhya’s Milkipur, political parties began pulling out all stops to sway the electorate. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has set its sights on ‘Mission Milkipur’ in Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently said: “If Kundarki could be won, then why not Milkipur?\" The statement caused a stir in UP’s political circles, significantly raising the stakes for the upcoming bypoll. related stories The BJP has deployed six ministers to keep a vigilant eye on Milkipur, with CM Adityanath overseeing electoral preparations. On the other hand, the Samajwadi Party (SP) is banking on its trusted Picchda Dalit Alpsankhyak (PDA) formula to consolidate its vote base, setting the stage for an intense political battle. The bypoll is necessitated as Awadhesh Prasad, the MLA of Milkipur, which falls in Ayodhya on the border of Amethi and Sultanpur, got elected as an MP from Faizabad (Ayodhya).

It got votes in the name of development. It was due to party workers that we succeeded in winning seven of the nine seats in the UP bypolls,\" said Adityanath. The UP CM was addressing party workers at Acharya Narendra Dev Agricultural University in Ayodhya. He also told workers to get maximum votes at their respective booths. “Contact and communication is the best way to win. Party workers should compete among themselves to win their booth, gram sabha and mandal with maximum votes,\" the CM said. WHY KUNDARKI IS A BENCHMARK The UP CM’s statement created a flutter in political circles. “The Milkipur bypoll is no less than a battle of prestige for the BJP, especially after it lost the Ayodhya Lok Sabha seat to the SP in the April-June general elections in 2024. Of the other 9 seats for which bypolls were held, the Kundarki seat was critical, especially due to its complex caste equations. However, the BJP managed a decisive victory in the Muslim-dominated Kundarki seat in Moradabad, traditionally an SP stronghold. This also sets the benchmark and hence the party is in plans to apply the same strategy in Milkipur,\" said Shashikant Pandey, head department of political science Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow. SPLIT IN MUSLIM VOTES A KEY FACTOR IN KUNDARKI SUCCESS BJP’s Ramveer Thakur won Kundarki after a long wait of 31 years, with a margin of over 1.4 lakh. His closest rival and three-time MLA, SP’s Haji Rizwan, lost his bail amount, securing a mere 25,580 votes. Thakur created history by being the only Hindu candidate from the Muslim-dominated seat. “A split in Muslim votes was the main reason behind the BJP’s win. Barring the BJP, all parties, including the SP, fielded Muslim candidates,\" said Pandey. Adityanath also urged six ministers and party functionaries to intensify poll preparations and electorate mobilisation in Ayodhya’s Milkipur. While the BJP plans to push for Hindu unity with slogans such as ‘Batenge toh katenge’ (If we are divided, we’ll be slaughtered), the SP aims to retain its stronghold with its PDA strategy. MILKIPUR LIKELY TO SEE ‘PASI VS PASI’ There are rumours that the BJP may field former Milkipur MLA Baba Gorakhnath, a Pasi, who narrowly lost to SP’s Awadhesh Prasad in 2022 by 13,000 votes. Notably, in 2017, Gorakhnath, then 32, defeated the 72-year-old Prasad by more than 26,000 votes, a victory that coincided with the BJP’s landslide win in Uttar Pradesh and Adityanath’s rise to the chief minister’s office. The SP, too, is gearing up for the poll battle and is set to bank on its trusted PDA formula. The SP has fielded Awadhesh Prasad’s son, Ajit, a Pasi, turning the contest into a ‘Pasi vs Pasi’ battle in Milkipur, which has a significant Dalit and OBC population. MILKIPUR BYPOLL ON FEBRUARY 5 While announcing last month’s bypolls for 10 vacant assembly seats of UP, the Election Commission of India (ECI) had skipped Milkipur following a writ petition filed by BJP candidate Baba Gorakhnath, who contested the 2022 assembly elections from the seat. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Gorakhnath had challenged the victory...",

This is the process that all election commissioners follow, irrespective of annoucement for state or general elections. However, what makes Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar’s media interaction different is his style of addressing using ‘shayari’ or Urdu poetry. The announcement for 2025 Delhi election dates was no different. While responding to those questioning EVMs and the electoral process, Kumar on Tuesday said: “ Sab sawaal ki ehmiyat rakhte hain, jawab toh banta hai. Aadatan qalam-band jawab dete rahe, aaj roobaru bhi banta hai. Kya pata kal ho na ho, aaj jawab toh banta hai. \" related stories This loosely translates to: All questions are important. Hence, we must answer them. We usually have a habit of replying in writing but we must respond face-to-face today. We never know if tomorrow comes or not, hence replying to questions today is important. The second ‘shayari’ came while Kumar was talking about political leaders who come out with allegations of ballot rigging after election results. “ Kar na sakein ikraar toh koi baat nahi, meri wafa ka unko aitbaar toh hai. Shikayat bhale hi unki majboori ho, magar sunna, sehna, suljhana humari aadat toh hai .\" This poetry loosely translates to: It’s alright even if they don’t agree. They still have faith in my loyalty. May be complaining is a compulsion for them. But it’s our habit to listen, bear and sort things out. Reciting his third ‘shayari’ on those doubting the work of Election Commission, Rajiv Kumar said, “ Aaropon aur ilzamaat ka daur chale, koi gila nahi. Jhooth ke gubbaron ko bulandi mile, koi shikwa nahi. Har parinaam mein pramaand dete hain par woh bina saboot shakk ki nayi duniya raunak karte hain. Aur shakk ka ilaaj toh haqeem luqman ke paas bhi nahi .\" The above poetry loosely translates to: I have no complaints in this era of blame game and allegations, neither will I object to balloons of lies flying high. We keep giving proof on every result day but they keep lighting a new world of doubts without any evidence. And there’s no cure for doubts — neither a wise man can help nor a physician.

(PTI) In the complex, caste-driven political landscape of Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar and RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav now seem to be maneuvering to maintain their political relevance. Amidst this, Prashant Kishor, with his Jan Suraaj Party, emerges as the potential political disruptor—not by securing seats or forming alliances, but by siphoning votes that could alter electoral outcomes. Kishor’s current approach to the BPSC (Bihar Public Service Commission) scam has revealed a deeper, wisely calculated political strategy which goes beyond just reacting to the issue at hand. His decision to start a hunger strike until the demand for re-examination is met, and his willingness to court arrest — including his refusal to sign a bail bond to remain in jail — speaks volumes about his political acumen and his intent. related stories The BPSC protest move is not merely about protesting against the scam. Instead, it is more about positioning himself as the voice of the people, especially Bihar’s youth, and also against an alleged corrupt system in the state as it is to go to polls in the next nine to 10 months. In the caste-based fractured society in the state, Kishor’s decision to take such a bold stance comes at a time when Bihar’s political landscape is readying for a major shift that may be seen in the next assembly polls. This clearly indicates how Kishor is capitalising on the growing and pent-up discontent surrounding issues like corruption, governance, and mismanagement in Bihar, all of which may sway public opinion in the lead-up to the state elections. By tying his personal actions to the larger narrative of political accountability, Kishor is now trying to position himself as a champion of transparency and justice, appealing to voters who are wary of the old political guard. Jan Suraaj and its sunlight moment Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party, which that was floated with much pomp and show on Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday on October 2, 2024, fought its first-ever election next month as the state saw bypolls in four assembly constituencies. The party, which was still at a nascent stage, fought on all four seats that went to bypolls. It had a strong showing in the bypolls, where it secured over 23 per cent votes on Imamganj seat and more than 11 per cent in Belganj, further solidifying Kishor’s political standing. For a first-time electoral outing, these results are quite impressive, signaling that Kishor’s message somewhat resonates with a significant portion of the electorate, despite the limited time and resources available to his party. This electoral success, combined with his latest protest actions, reflect that Kishor is not just looking to be a fleeting political figure, but is also preparing to be a key player in Bihar’s upcoming elections. His political-electoral strategy seems to be a calculated mix of grassroots mobilisation, some direct actions along with an emotional appeal, and having a high-pitched sub-regionalism or commonly called sub-nationalism through his slogan ‘Jai Bihar’. By taking such a visible stand against the BPSC scam, Kishor is not only addressing an issue that affects the common man and the unemployed but aspirational youth of Bihar, but also positioning himself as someone willing to fight for the people, even if it means taking a few personal risks. It is surely a message that aligns well with the electorate’s growing desire for change and reform in Bihar’s politics, especially as the state gears up for its next round of electoral battles. The sharp edge of the Bihar triangle Political experts feel that if Kishor continues with the momentum he created, he will be able to damage the voter base of both political stalwarts of Bihar — Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav. As both these politicians are now part of national alliances — NDA and INDIA bloc respectively — Kishor’s outreach may bring more harm to the RJD than it does to the JDU. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “Prashant Kishor has already done the frontal attack on JDU’s governance, exposing its failures in education policy and the BPSC scandal.

(AP) The stage is all set for the Delhi Dangal. The Election Commission on Tuesday announced the dates for the high-stakes assembly election to the Capital where voting will take place on February 5 and the results will be announced on February 8. The first major electoral battle of 2025 will see a triangular contest among the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Congress. The term of the Delhi assembly is due to end on February 23. related stories For the AAP, which has battled corruption charges and seen its top brass cool their heels in prison, the elections are a litmus test to prove that the party — which was birthed from an anti-corruption movement — still rules over the hearts of Delhiites. Arvind Kejriwal’s party, which has ruled Delhi with a full majority since 2015, is hoping that its schemes such as free electricity, water, and free bus rides for women, apart from a monthly stipend of Rs 2,100, free healthcare for the elderly, and a waiver of inflated water bills will help it retain power in the Capital. Meanwhile, the BJP, which has been out of power in Delhi for over 26 years, is keen to claw back power from Kejriwal and AAP. In a scathing attack on AAP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while kicking off BJP’s poll campaign, equated its rule in Delhi to “AAPda (disaster)\". The saffron party has upped the ante against the ruling AAP by targeting Kejriwal’s extravagant expenditure on the CM’s bungalow when he held the top post. For the Congress, the 2025 contest is a do-or-die battle. The Grand Old Party has been unable to open its account in the Capital — which it ruled for 15 years — in the previous two elections. Snubbed by the AAP, with whom it is fighting on the national level as part of the INDIA bloc, the Congress has been trying to revive its fortunes. It has promised Rs 2,500 monthly to women under the ‘Pyaari Didi Yojana’ if voted back to power. As the political temperatures rise, let’s take a look at key issues that have dominated and will continue to drive the Delhi discourse: CORRUPTION In an ironic turn of events, the AAP, which came to power on the anti-corruption plank, was embroiled in a liquor scam, faced cases of money laundering, and even faced barbs over the expensive renovation at the chief minister’s residence. The party’s top brass was forced to spend time in jail, ranging from six months to two years. However, now out on bail, the AAP has hit the electoral track running and accused the BJP of trying to implicate its leaders to intimidate them into jumping ship. The BJP, meanwhile, has accused Kejriwal of being the master puppeteer who knows all about the scams right under his nose. The party, while sharpening its attack on the former CM’s ‘Sheesh Mahal’, accused the AAP convener of diverting people’s money to fund his extravagant project. Home Minister Amit Shah alleged that over Rs 6 crore was spent on designer marbles, Rs 6 crore on motorised curtains, Rs 70 lakh on automatic doors, Rs 50 lakh on carpets and Rs 64 lakh on smart TVs at the chief minister’s residence when Kejriwal occupied it. The voter sentiment on the corruption issue seems divided. While many believe the AAP is a victim of vendetta politics, others feel the party has lost its sheen and joined the bandwagon of tainted outfits. CIVIC ISSUES Mounds of garbage, overflowing drains, water shortage or supply of dirty water and damaged roads have become major issues for voters in the Capital. While the BJP blames AAP for the urban apathy, the latter claims the saffron party has only tried to defame it and stall the work of the MCD. Delhi’s dwindling air quality, which returns to haunt the Capital in winters every year, has also become a bone of contention between the two parties. Unfortunately, the ultimate losers in the tug-of-war are Delhiites who are forced to deal with unaddressed civic issues. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all ROW OVER VOTER ROLLS The controversy over the alleged manipulation of electoral rolls in the Capital escalated after Delhi Chief Minister Atishi wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, seeking another round of verification of the voter deletions in the New Delhi assembly constituency.

(ECI) While announcing the schedule of Delhi Assembly elections, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar attempted to dispel the notions of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) being hacked by recalling tech mogul Elon Musk’s remarks last year that added fuel to the fire surrounding the debate on EVM credibility. The poll panel chief started answering the questions raised against alleged electoral roll, EVMs and voter turnout manipulation using his usual style of Shayaris, beginning by saying, “Aaj Jawab Toh Banta Hai.\" related stories Without mentioning his name, Kumar referred to Elon Musk’s previous remarks calling for EVMS to be “eliminated\" as they were at the risk of being hacked by humans or artificial intelligence. Musk had asserted that paper ballots were crucial for honest and fair elections. “It’s a misconceived narrative. A global IT expert said EVMs can be hacked while our elections were going on. They (America) don’t have EVMs, they have electronic voting mechanisms. The remarks created a pandemonium here. The same expert later said that India takes a single day to finish counting while the US takes over a month. We just follow the narratives that are suiting,\" Kumar said at the presser. The Chief Election Commissioner staunchly defended the voting system and rubbished the opposition’s claims of EVM tampering. After the recently held Maharashtra elections, concerns were raised by opposition parties over the surge in voter turnout post-evening. “EVMs are tamper-proof. They undergo scrutiny at every stage. From commissioning, which takes place around 7-8 days before polling day, to counting, the EVMs are never out of the sight of the candidate and officials even once and at every step, political party agents and candidates are informed,\" he said, adding that there was no question of hacking or rigging an EVM. What Did Elon Musk Say On EVMs? In June, just after the Lok Sabha elections that saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi returning to a historic third term in India, Elon Musk made headlines by calling for the “elimination\" of EVMs. “We should eliminate electronic voting machines. The risk of being hacked by humans or AI, while small, is still too high,\" he said on X. Responding to the remark, former Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar called Musk’s concerns a “huge sweeping generalisation\" and said Indian EVMs are custom-designed, secure and isolated from any network or media with no connectivity. “This is a huge sweeping generalization statement that implies no one can build secure digital hardware. Wrong. Elon Musk’s view may apply to the US and other places – where they use regular compute platforms to build Internet-connected Voting machines,\" Chandrasekhar wrote.

(Image: PTI) The Aam Aadmi Party has announced that monthly stipend for women aged 18 years and above under Mukhya Mantri Mahila Samman Yojana has been hiked to Rs 2,100 from Rs 1,000 proposed earlier. In a competitive space, after women voters of Maharashtra rewarded the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress too unveiled its ‘Pyari Didi Yojana’ promising a monthly allowance of Rs 2,500 to eligible women.

(PTI) Ramesh Bidhuri has done it again. Just days after the BJP fielded the former Delhi MP—who had used a communal slur against then-sitting MP Danish Ali—for the upcoming elections, Bidhuri used a sexist remark against Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, saying the party will “build roads like Priyanka Gandhi’s cheeks\" in the constituency if it comes to power. He continued his diatribe with yet another attack, this time on Delhi Chief Minister Atishi, saying: “Atishi ne baap badal liya. Kejriwal bauna Duryodhan hai. [Atishi has changed her father.

UP AGAINST 2 STRONG WOMEN While he may have escaped both the law as well as any major disciplinary action by his party so far, Bidhuri will have to face two strong women in Kalkaji, where he made the controversial statement about Priyanka Gandhi. He will face sitting chief minister of Delhi and Kejriwal’s confidant Atishi. Atishi, a Rhodes scholar and St Stephen’s alumni who joined as an adviser to Manish Sisodia and made her way to the top seat in the government, is known to be someone who does not mince her words and gives a strong fight.

Lamba started her career with student politics and reached the Delhi Assembly via the Aam Aadmi Party. She later quit AAP to return to her old party, citing ‘disrespect’. While Atishi blamed the “anti-women mentality of Ramesh Bidhuri\" on the entire BJP, Bidhuri was quick to retract his statement. However, the damage was done.

(Image: News18) Whether Arvind Kejriwal’s poll promise of Rs 2,100 to Delhi women bears fruit or not for the Aam Aadmi Party is yet to be seen, the probable beneficiaries of the ‘Mahila Samman’ scheme, however, seem to be in favour of a larger picture that shows them with a new skill and a job in hand. 54-year-old housewife Gayatri Yadav believes that a new skill training and a job, even if it pays Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 per month, would make women more independent and stronger in the longer run than Rs 2,100 in bank account from a government who will be elected just for five years. related stories “Even if I say this is good, how long can you expect the government to pay? The governments are there just for five years. What will happen if they are elected out of power? They themselves are saying the BJP will stop every free scheme they are offering. If the AAP really wants to empower women, there should be enough options for them to learn and work,\" she said while talking to News18. Echoing her sentiment, her relative Sumedha, in her 40s, added that this amount, if the government wishes, can be in addition to the money women will earn from a new job. “The scheme can be very helpful for women who are homeless or are beggars. But will they be eligible for this scheme? Do they have bank accounts? This money will go to women who are from well-to-do families. Those who really need this money can never get it,\" she said. Harshita Thapa, 38, believes that this money should be used by the government to make better facilities for women. “Look at the toilets across the city. Why cannot this money be used for building and maintaining toilets? The buses (DTC) are always crowded. Why cannot this money be used for bringing more buses? Will it not help women? It will not offer us a comfortable ride? All these issues are very common and faced by women across all the classes,\" she said. A group of women, in their 50s, also believed that the city government should provide some other form of relief and it should not be cash alone. Sangeeta Goel from Delhi Cantt, who was shopping with her friends in Janpath, said the scheme should be based on financial status of a woman. “This money should be used in some better form. Or at least it should be for women who are from poor families. It should not be for everyone. If it is for very poor women from the city, how will they register? They don’t have IDs and bank accounts and may also not be a voter in Delhi. Also, we know that husbands take away money from women for alcohol. There can be more steps to enhance safety for women,\" Goel said. The women assured that they will not register for the scheme as they opposed the idea. “People will take whatever they get for free. But the government should see what is important and what is not… The free electricity scheme is benefiting only a small section. The scope should be increased to cover more units. They can use this money in providing subsidies of some form… There should be efforts to check inflation,\" they said. The group believed that while on one hand the government provides something free to one section, it takes the money from the public in the form of some tax. Eventually it is the working class that is paying for everything free the government is providing to anyone. “The free water and electricity scheme is not enough. The middle class is not able to benefit from it. The money should be used to increase the scope,\" they said, adding that they also believe the money should not be given free but some skills and jobs for women. Some women were happy with the idea of getting Rs 2,100 but also added that they will believe in the scheme only if the money will actually start being credited to their account. One among these was a hawker Mangla in her 60s. A voter from New Delhi Assembly, she said these things are said only to seek votes but nothing changes on ground for the poor. “They say they will give us money in every election. But nothing changes for us. I spent my entire lifetime in Delhi. I saw the government coming and going. But there was no improvement in our situation. I earn Rs 200-300 daily.

A wildcard advantage for BJP could be the Congress and BSP contesting on all 70 seats and eating into AAP's votes reset Follow us on Google News Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks during a public meeting at Rohini in New Delhi on Sunday. (PTI) Can the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) end its 27-year-long power drought in Delhi? The party is employing a multi-pronged strategy to live up to this challenge as it senses “anti-incumbency\" against the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) decade-long rule, and feels that the narrative of AAP’s corruption and misgovernance has percolated to the masses. related stories The BJP’s campaign is also very localised this time, with the Prime Minister speaking about sewers and water-logged roads and the DTC fleet, in a marked shift from the ‘national’ issues campaign run by the BJP in Delhi in the past. The effort is to touch the pulse of the common Delhiite on the issues he is facing day in and day out. The BJP’s strategy seems to be on five political pillars, glimpses of which have been evident in the two public addresses of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi last week. #DelhiPolls | PM Narendra Modi sets the tone for Delhi elections: Hits top gear with ‘AAP’-da attacko @AmanKayamHai_ shares more details #Delhi #BJP #PMModi #AAP | @AvantikaInToday pic.twitter.com/tevMMGpMo3 — News18 (@CNNnews18) January 5, 2025 Modi is again the BJP’s face in Delhi and the party is not projecting any chief ministerial face. The PM and home minister Amit Shah are leading the attack on AAP on the ‘sheeshmahal’ campaign around the CM’s affluent residence, feeling this is AAP’s Achilles’ heel. The BJP is highlighting the AAP’s misgovernance from the state of the Yamuna to air pollution, to try to keep the campaign ‘local’. It says Delhi needs a ‘double-engine’ government run by the BJP. The BJP is planning a strong counter to AAP’s two major weapons – free electricity, and the Rs-2,100 promise to women. The BJP has also made a major overture to slum-dwellers who are a major vote bank, with Modi saying everyone will get a pucca home. The BJP is hoping that the Congress and the BSP will dent AAP’s votes in multiple seats, and the BJP may gain from it. MODI IS THE FACE Leading the charge against the AAP again is the BJP’s top face, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This was also the case in 2020 when the BJP lost. The BJP had projected Kiran Bedi as their chief ministerial face in 2015, but that ended in a disaster as the AAP won as many as 67 out of the 70 seats in Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal and his party are taking potshots at the BJP asking who their “dulha\" (bridegroom) is in these elections. But the BJP feels that there are bigger issues in this election than a CM face. It is buoyed by the wins in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in 2023 without projecting any CM face. The two posters released by the BJP so far only have Modi as the face on them. The BJP feels the AAP has complicated its own strategy by saying that Kejriwal will replace Atishi as the CM if the AAP wins, despite the Supreme Court putting stiff conditions on Kejriwal while granting him bail.

This explains PM Modi and Shah leading the attack on the issue. “I never built a house for myself…I could also have built a sheeshmahal but my dream has been that the poor get a concrete house,\" PM Modi said at a rally on Friday. A latest CAG report , which has not been tabled in the Delhi Assembly yet, has also posed serious questions on the lavish expenditure on refurbishing and renovating the CM’s residence in Delhi. The PM has led the attack on this CAG report as well, saying Kejriwal was focused on building the “sheeshmahal\" at a time when the national capital was struggling with Covid. FAILED GOVERNANCE MODEL The BJP is also doubling down on the state of the Yamuna river, and the persistent air pollution issue in the national capital, to corner the AAP’s governance model in Delhi. The PM has termed AAP as “AAP-Da\" or a calamity for Delhi. While the AAP is showcasing its health and education model in Delhi, the BJP is trying to tell the people that the AAP has failed on core governance issues such as the sewa...",

(Getty) Before every election, political parties get into a verbal clash over the updation of electoral rolls. Now, as Delhi is gearing up for assembly polls, the picture is no different. While the opposition BJP is accusing AAP of adding unauthorised names in the list, the latter has been attacking the saffron party for deletion of valid names. In February 2024, the BJP filed a complaint with the Election Commission (EC) that West Bengal has 16 lakh fake voters. In January 2024, similar issues were raised in Andhra Pradesh when the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the BJP filed a complaint over ‘fake names’ in the state voters’ list. When Maharashtra went to polls in November 2024, Congress raised the issue again. In 2018 and 2019, before the Lok Sabha polls, BJP and AAP indulged in similar blame-games in Delhi. related stories But how exactly are names added and deleted from the electoral roll? Is it really possible to delete or add names by simply directing the Election Commission’s office? The answer is no. The updation or addition of names requires house-to-house survey, physical field verification, display and sharing of list of claims and objections, supervision and random checking. It also involves sharing of draft and final electoral roll with political parties. There is also a rigorous Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) for deletion of names. Speaking to News18, a poll body official said the creation, maintenance and purification of electoral rolls is the core constitutional responsibility of the EC, with a well-defined and meticulously followed legacy over decades. “The credibility of the process is organically linked to data/facts over several revisions and continuous updation of previous data sets. The process is ensconced in a watertight statutory scheme which is rule-based,\" they said. The EC, they said, firmly believes that an inclusive, healthy, pure and transparently prepared electoral roll is the foundation of free, fair and credible elections. Involving All Stakeholders For a pure and healthy electoral roll, rules are followed from Article 324 of the Constitution of India, provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, Registration of the Electors Rules, 1960, and the extant instructions issued by the commission from time to time. All political parties are made aware of the SoPs for Special Summary Revision (SSR) and the special measures taken during SSR. Additions and deletions take place after due enquiry, in full public view and with participation of political parties at every stage of the process. Every entry in the electoral roll database, either by way of addition or deletion or transportation, is credible, as it is based on voluntariness of the citizen to enrol and an open disclosure and public hearing to objections, if any and, thereafter, the entries are available for perpetual scrutiny and legal challenge. To ensure that each and every information is available with the various stakeholders, free copies of the draft and final electoral rolls, along with weekly lists of claims and objections, are provided to recognised political parties to make them aware about the process to avoid any post facto objection or grievances. The draft and final rolls are hosted on the CEO/ District Election Officer (DEO) websites and the rolls are displayed at designated polling stations location and Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) offices notice board. During the continuous updation period, monthly pooling of lists of additions, deletions, and modifications are published on the website of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) for the information of the general public. EC has provided the provision of the appointment of Booth Level Agents (BLA) by the recognised political parties as an extra facilitation to them, ensuring utmost transparency in the process. BLAs do not interfere with the registration process and in the functioning of Booth Level Officer (BLOs) but only identify and flag any discrepancy or impurity in the electoral roll of the polling station/party concerned. Enrolling Every Eligible Citizen The ECI even allows homeless people to get registered as voters. For that, the Booth Level Officer visits the address given in Form 6 at night to ascertain that the homeless person actually sleeps at the place which is given as his address in Form 6.

In the 24 sessions held in the year 2024, there was no question hour — one of the most critical aspects of democracy. Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel, while speaking to News18, said there were two reasons behind the unusual phenomenon. The first, he said, was late or lack of reply from the departments as it was often said that the subject was out of the Delhi government’s control. related stories “Question Hour was being held and MLAs were asking questions but there was no reply. The MLAs got fed up and stopped asking questions…There is another reason that Question Hour is not held many times as there was no notice of 12 ‘clear’ days between the announcement of session and the actual session date,\" he told News18. Goel added: “There are so many questions around Delhi Development Authority (DDA), including why land is not being allocated. Replies are not coming from the revenue department as they say DDA is not under them. Similarly, if there is any question around services, the department turns it down and refuses to answer. If someone asks questions on law and order, it is said this is not a subject of the Delhi government… All the important issues were left behind,\" he said. Delhi is a Union Territory with an assembly. The city government does not have control over land, law and order and services. As per the official website of the Delhi Assembly, the rules for Question and Answer state that no less than 12 days’ notice is to be given in writing to the assembly secretary. ‘Clear days’ include Saturdays, Sundays and holidays but do not include the date of receipt of a notice by the Secretariat. It also says members have a right to ask questions to elicit information on matters of public importance from the government. The Question Hour is the most popular device available to a member to raise issues in the House. “Rule 29 of the Delhi Assembly Rules states that a question must relate to a matter of administration for which the Government is responsible. Its purpose should be to elicit information or to give suggestions of action on a matter of public importance,\" the rules read. In December 2023, when a three-day session was called, 252 notices of questions were received. Since 2020, when the term of the current assembly started, a total of 1,095 questions have been listed.

(PTI) The stage is set for an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi. Having come late to the poll fest despite earlier ruling the Capital for three terms, the Congress — snubbed by AAP — doesn’t want to cede an inch. Hence, similar to the guarantees it announced in other poll-bound states like Haryana and Maharashtra, in Delhi too, the Grand Old Party will announce five guarantees in a phased manner. related stories The idea behind phasing out the announcements is to ensure it keeps the momentum going and also so that the party can tweak its promises along the way in line with what other parties announce. Sources say the five guarantees to be announced from January 6-11 are: 1. Direct Cash Transfer for Women: Aimed at empowering women voters, the Congress plans to introduce a direct cash transfer scheme. 2. Comprehensive Insurance Coverage: The party intends to offer insurance coverage worth over Rs 20-25 lakh for all residents, enhancing social security across the Capital. 3. Support for Unemployed Youth: To address unemployment, the Congress proposes cash incentives for jobless youth, coupled with apprenticeship training programmes to enhance their skills and employability. 4. Unique Ration Kits for Households: In an effort to support families, a distinctive ration kit containing daily essentials will be provided to households, ensuring access to necessary commodities. 5. Electricity: Like the AAP, the Congress too will announce free electricity up to 400 watts for lower-income group areas. The Congress has a tough fight ahead as it has to challenge both the BJP and the AAP in a race where it has lagged behind. The AAP-Congress divorce means the INDIA bloc is doddering. The Congress also wants to target the same vote bank that it shares with AAP which has grown in Delhi at the cost of the Grand Old Party. While the latter hopes to rectify this, the task is easier said than done. At the announcement of another sop from AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, where he promised to waive off inflated electricity bills if his party comes to power, the former Delhi chief minister dismissed the Congress, saying: “Why do you take the Congress seriously?

(Image: X) Aam Aadmi Party convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced that the Delhi government will start registrations for post-poll schemes – Mahila Samman and Sanjivani Yojana – from December 23, asking people to keep their voter cards ready. Kejriwal, who has said time and again that a lot of voters are being removed from the electoral roll ahead of the Delhi assembly elections, asked potential beneficiaries to check their names in the voter list. The first and most basic criteria for these schemes is that beneficiaries must be registered as a voter in Delhi. related stories Addressing the media, he said for the registrations, the people will not have to go anywhere. For their convenience, the teams will go from door to door. About the Mahila Samman Yojana, where each woman aged above 18 will receive Rs 2,100 every month, the former Delhi chief minister said it will help young women to pursue higher education. “The housewives will be able to contribute to household expenses as the inflation is high due to the policies of the central government… I want to say that the registration will start from Monday. You don’t have to stand in a queue and waste your time. We will come to your home,\" he said. He further said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had formed teams that will visit each house. All the women in a household will be registered and given a card. “You need to keep that card safe,\" he added. On the Sanjivani Yojana, under which all senior citizens in Delhi will be entitled to free medical treatment, Kejriwal said there is no one to care for the middle class in India. He said no government had done anything for them and many people work hard as well as pay taxes worth lakhs and crores to contribute for nation building. “When they are retired, there is no one to take care of them. Health is a major issue in old age. I want to tell them all that now you don’t have to worry. The AAP will take care of your medical expenses. The registration for this scheme will also be done from Monday door to door,\" he said. He also said for these schemes, the beneficiaries need to be a voter in Delhi so people should keep their voter card ready when the registration team arrives. “You should also check that your name is not deleted from the voter list. A lot of voters are being removed from the list. They (BJP) don’t want you to get the benefit of these schemes. If your name is removed, please tell the visiting team about it. We will add you to the list,\" he added. The AAP leader said along with Chief Minister Atishi and former deputy Manish Sisoida, he will visit different parts of the national capital for the registrations. Both these schemes have not yet been implemented and will only become a reality if the AAP is re-elected in the 2025 assembly polls, likely to be held in February. Kejriwal said there will be around 35 to 40 lakh women and 10 to 15 lakh senior citizens, who are potential beneficiaries. Hitting out at opposition BJP, he said the party lacked vision for Delhi. “For the entire election in Delhi, they (BJP) don’t have any narrative and vision for the people of Delhi.

(PTI) Delhi L-G VK Saxena’s go-ahead to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to prosecute former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has heated up the scene for Delhi polls that could take place in February. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was formed on the plank of ending corruption, with Kejriwal projecting himself as a “clean politician\". However, the BJP and Congress have relentlessly attacked and questioned these credentials. related stories The first reaction to the L-G’s move came from Kejriwal’s aide and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia who said on X: “If the L-G has given the go-ahead to ED to prosecute, then where is the copy of this? It’s clear this is a rumour.\" In fact, all AAP leaders have questioned and asked for proof of the L-G’s approval. Whatever may be the case, the AAP is bound to use the development to make the point that the BJP is rattled and is once again misusing agencies to arm-twist its opponents. Not just this, AAP will also try to incur sympathy and use this to reach out to its voters for Delhi polls. But, for the BJP, this is proof they would want to flaunt to show that the AAP is soaked in corruption — right up to the top. It maintains that the liquor-gate issue is one which shows that the former chief minister is the “kingpin\" and he cannot escape culpability. They are also making the point that the ED note gives evidence of hotel stay and money emanating from the former CM’s office and if he comes back to power, corruption will be at its peak, with benefits not going to the people. BJP Delhi president Virendra Sachdeva has said: “It is clear that Kejriwal is the kingpin of the Delhi excise policy scam and as investigation progresses, he will be punished.\" For the BJP, it’s a do-or-die battle. Being out of power in Delhi for the last 12 years, it’s important for the party to bounce back and ensure that one of the bastions of the INDIA bloc crumbles. BJP knows that if AAP loses in Delhi, Punjab too could be up for grabs. For the Congress, it’s a tough fight. However, despite the flip-flop in the party over the alliance with AAP, the Congress has decided to fight back. In fact, Sheila Dikshit’s son and former MP Sandeep Dikshit has been fielded opposite Kejriwal. He told News18 recently: “This was expected and it is something that should have been done earlier. There was enough evidence to prosecute him.\" Interestingly, it was the Congress that had first raised the liquor-gate issue against Kejriwal when they were not friends. For now, the game is on and the BJP and AAP will fight on the corruption slogan in the battle for Delhi. What is the excise scam? The excise case pertains to alleged corruption and money laundering in formulating and executing the Delhi government’s excise policy for 2021-22, which was later scrapped. L-G Saxena had recommended a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities. Subsequently, the ED registered a case under the PMLA. Kejriwal, 55, and the AAP have been named as accused in the supplementary charge sheet filed in the case. Regarding Kejriwal’s role, the 209-page charge sheet said, “Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Minister of NCT of Delhi is the kingpin and key conspirator of the Delhi excise scam in collusion with ministers of Delhi govt, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders and other persons.\" top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “Arvind Kejriwal has directly used part of these proceeds of crime personally by making Chanpreet Singh (another accused in the case) make payment for Sh Arvind Kejriwal’s stay and event at the Grand Hyatt, Goa,\" the agency claimed. It said that Kejriwal also “mingled\" these proceeds of crime with the funds of the Delhi government. It has been alleged that the ‘South Group’ of politicians and liquor businessmen gave Rs 100 crore worth of kickbacks to gain a favourable position in the Delhi excise policy for 2021-22 and out of these funds, Rs 45 crore was sent for the AAP campaign in Goa during the 2022 assembly polls. tags : aam aadmi party arvind kejriwal BJP congress delhi elections excise scam Location : New Delhi, India First Published: December 21, 2024, 13:46 IST News elections How L-G Nod To Prosecute Arvind Kejriwal Could Impact Delhi Election Game Read More",

(X) Ahead of the 2025 Delhi elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is taking a leaf out of rival Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s playbook. In the 2020 polls, the party’s vote share was 38.51 per cent, while that of the AAP was 53.57 per cent. The massive gap of 15 per cent meant the BJP won just eight seats out of 70, ensuring an AAP sweep with 62 seats. Cut to December 2024, the BJP is actively trying to win over two loyal bases of AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal to minimise the gap — auto drivers and slum dwellers. related stories DENT IN 93,000 FAMILIES’ VOTES Auto drivers are considered traditional supporters of AAP since its anti-corruption movement when the vehicle was used to disseminate anti-Congress messaging. When India Against Corruption metamorphosed into AAP, auto drivers remained loyal to Kejriwal and the party reaped its political benefit in successive polls. There are an estimated 93,000 auto-rickshaws in Delhi, which are being counted as 93,000 families and their votes — a vote bank that BJP is aggressively attempting to win over sensing a mistrust against AAP among a section of auto drivers ever since Kejriwal’s alleged flamboyant lifestyle hit headlines. Kejriwal’s success in capturing this base very early was by identifying himself as a commoner fighting the system. Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva engaged with auto drivers over tea at the Nizamuddin Railway Station on Wednesday, claiming Kejriwal did not fulfil basic promises like auto stands or stopping the practice of rampant seizing of autos. “In 2014, Kejriwal made 10 promises to auto drivers. However, neither were those promises were fulfilled, nor any efforts were made by his government towards fulfilling them,\" Sachdeva alleged. On Monday too, Sachdeva addressed more than 1,000 auto drivers from central and west districts of Delhi, explaining to them why Kejriwal had failed them. BJP insiders say even if the party is able to swing 30-40 per cent of Delhi’s 93,000 auto drivers towards itself, it will help BJP increase its vote share. TARGET: WIN BACK 1,194 SLUMS If auto drivers were one of AAP’s earliest allies, even before they took the political plunge, votes across Delhi’s 1,194 slum clusters — known as jhuggi jhopri colonies — too have been steadfast in their support for the broom since an early stage. However, with Kejriwal’s ‘Common Man’ image taking a severe beating with allegations of irregularities over the alleged liquor scam and reports of opulence on display in the name of renovation of his official residence, many residents of these slum clusters started feeling a disconnect from AAP. The BJP was quick to exploit it. Party leaders stayed overnight in 1,194 slum clusters across the city to interact directly with the residents and understand their challenges. During the overnight stay, the BJP leaders dined with residents, keeping it as real as possible. For instance, Sachdeva had a meal with slum dwellers as part of the night slum stay campaign at Rajiv Camp in Jhilmil. He wasn’t alone. BJP’s national general secretary Dushyant Gautam and MP Ramvir Singh Bidhuri are among many who took part in this outreach. BJP, under the Slum Expansion Campaign, has appointed slum-expanders or vistaraks and slum-caretakers who are tasked to run the drive across Delhi, once the leaders leave. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Sources say feedback has also started pouring in. A major concern among some slum dwellers has been whether their slums will be destroyed after being deemed illegal, particularly after chief minister Atishi held a press conference. Few other concerns are timely water supply, fumigation during monsoon and food through the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB). The BJP is hopeful that unless some major freebie announcements are made for the urban poor before poll date declaration, they are on the right course to stake claim on two of Kejriwal’s most treasured bases. tags : aam aadmi party arvind kejriwal BJP delhi elections news18 specials Location : New Delhi, India First Published: December 18, 2024, 12:11 IST News elections Delhi Polls: BJP Targets AAP’s Loyal Base Of Auto Drivers, Slum Clusters To Bridge 15% Vote Share Gap Read More",

Meanwhile, the AAP and Congress have released 70 and 21 names, respectively — adding worry to the BJP state leadership. Another BJP state leader, who is also an MLA, told News18, requesting anonymity, “We do not have any dearth of issues to expose Kejriwal this time.

In the first two lists, the AAP fielded 13 turncoats including those from the BJP like Brahm Singh Tanwar (Chhatarpur) and Jitender Singh Shunty (Shahdara). Kejriwal’s party has announced candidates on all 70 seats. On Monday, Delhi BJP President Virendraa Sachdeva held a closed-door meeting on what the party called organisational work and a future course of action was discussed. But with less than two months left for the Delhi election and BJP’s central leadership caught in a stormy Parliament session, discussion alone may not be the ideal solution in the face of AAP’s aggressive campaign — a knowledge that is making many Delhi BJP leaders jittery. tags : aam aadmi party Bharatiya Janata Party BJP delhi elections Location : New Delhi, India First Published: December 17, 2024, 10:06 IST News elections Parivartan Rally Cancelled, No List In Sight: Delhi BJP Leaders Getting Increasingly Jittery Read More",

(PTI File) As Bihar prepares for assembly elections next year, women are once again at the heart of the campaigns. Even as Janata Dal United (JDU) chief and CM Nitish Kumar started his ‘Mahila Samvad Yatra’, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) announced ‘Mai Bahan Maan Yojana’ (MBMY). Former Deputy CM and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav announced that if voted to power, his government would transfer Rs 2,500 every month in the bank accounts of “economically disadvantaged women and those from deprived sections of society\". related stories “This scheme will be launched and implemented within one month of the formation of our government in the state,\" he said. The scheme has been labelled as “RJD’s vision to empower women and bring happiness and security in every such household across the state\". RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said the announcement is a commitment towards women of Bihar. “This should not be seen only as an election stunt. Tejaswi Yadav earlier, too, has displayed his commitment towards the youth of Bihar by delivering on the promise of jobs. Now, he has announced money in the hands of women. Together, the schemes will make Bihari prosperous,\" Jha said. WOMEN VOTE BANK Yadav’s announcement in Darbhanga is seen as an attempt to woo women voters who have emerged as a vote bank in the recent elections. Women are traditionally seen as Nitish backers, especially supporting him in his liquor ban crusade. The RJD might be attempting to take a leaf out of the BJP’s playbook in MP and Maharashtra and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha’s in Jharkhand to derail this crucial base of Nitish Kumar. Analysts believe that in the recently concluded elections in Jharkhand, Hemant Soren’s Maiya Samman Yojana ensured absolute majority for the JMM in spite of a stiff challenge from the BJP. Soren had promised to hike the Maiya Samman monthly pay to Rs 2,500 if voted to power.

Delhi finance commission too, as per reports, has flagged concerns about the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s decision to offer similar cash transfer to women voters of Delhi. But Yadav said he has announced the scheme after proper study. “I appeal to all my mothers and sisters to come forward and bless their own and ensure that the scheme is implemented, as their ‘dukh’ (sorrows) are his own. The new scheme is scientifically researched and is feasible,\" he said. JDU BJP HIT BACK While INDIA alliance welcomed the announcement by Yadav, the NDA hit back.

Both the parties had knocked on the EC’s door, alleging irregularities in the electoral roll. related stories In its letter, the EC reiterated that the issues raised in representations of both the parties — BJP’s demand to delete illegal/temporary migrants, ghost voters, and AAP’s plea to not undertake mass deletions of voters without proper enquiry — have to be examined carefully and necessary action taken strictly following the laid-down statutory provisions and guidelines contained in the manual of electoral rolls. The EC directed the CEO that no deletion can take place without a corresponding Form-7 and all cases of deletions must be personally cross-verified by the Electoral Registration Officer if they fall in any of the two categories — deletions in polling stations where the number of deletions exceed 2 per cent of the total electors in the voter list of the polling station; and deletions where the same person is the objector in more than five cases. “I am directed to convey that the extant process should be scrupulously followed by the entire machinery involved in the revision process, including EROs, AEROs, BLO supervisors and BLOs, so as to ensure that changes in the electoral roll during the SSR period are backed by proper enquiry with fullest possible participation of the political parties,\" the ECI said.

The party lodged a protest against the enrollment of ‘lakhs of illegal infiltrator Rohingyas and Bangladeshi origin’ voters apart from duplicate voters, non-existent address voters and thousands of dead persons in the voter lists of Delhi. The BJP, with their 5,000 pages of evidence, demanded that the EC look into their complaint on legal merits on priority to ensure a true and transparent election for Delhi assembly. “…It’s surprising that new voter registration of lakhs of voters happens every time between the period of conclusion of Lok Sabha elections and start of assembly elections in Delhi which is abnormally higher than in the yearly voter summary revision exercise,\" the BJP said. Sachdeva said they will not let infiltrators and bogus voters vote, requesting the EC to run a campaign against enrollment of illegal voters as well as against illegal voting. Sachdeva said BJP BLAs and other workers have been visiting all 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi and have found the existence of lakhs of Bangladeshi or Rohingya-origin infiltrators registered as voters apart from duplicate voters and non-existent address voters. “Every constituency in Delhi has a huge number of dead or permanently shifted voters in Delhi.,\" they said.

(Image: PTI/File) When bastions crumble, upheaval takes place. The New Delhi constituency is one such bastion, which is seeing yet another challenge after 2013. That was the year when an activist and Income Tax officer Arvind Kejriwal was battle ready to take on three-time Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit from the New Delhi constituency, considered to be a fortress of the Congress. The result left many shocked as Kejriwal defeated her with over 25,000 votes, vowing to “send the corrupt CM to jail.\" After almost 11 years, Sheila Dikshit’s son Sandeep is getting ready to breach this bastion, which is now with Kejriwal. Congress, in its list of candidates for 2025 Delhi Assembly elections, has pitted Sandeep Dikshit opposite Arvind Kejriwal. Will it be a son’s revenge? After all, Sandeep has been a bitter critic of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and can never forget the harsh words Kejriwal used against his mother. related stories Sandeep Dikshit told News18, “No, I don’t see it as revenge. I see it as a fight to reclaim what was once a clean, green, developed Delhi. This is the city we want to give back to the people.\" But the Congress has made a shrewd choice in pitting Sandeep Dikshit opposite the former CM. It also now makes it clear that the Congress is no longer shying away from a direct fight with the AAP after Kejriwal snubbed the party and announced that he would have no alliance with them in Delhi. “Of course, I am very happy we are not going into an alliance with the AAP. They have destroyed Delhi and we want to save this city which was built by Sheila Dikshit,\" Sandeep said. Interestingly, Sandeep Dikshit, in the past year, has been building on his mother’s legacy. “Even her worst critics accept the fact that under her, Delhi was at its best. Several flyovers, development projects, roads, clean vehicles were her contribution. This is what we will build our campaign on,\" Sandeep said. There was a grudge that the Congress had used and thrown Sheila Dikshit and had neglected her in her last years. In fact, in UP polls, Sheila Dikshit was projected as the Brahmin CM face of the Congress but was dumped midway when the party went into an alliance with the SP as “ UP ke ladke “.

I was ready to contest from anywhere.\" ‘ Meri Delhi, Meri Shaan ‘ (My Delhi, My Pride) was Sheila Dikshit’s pitch for Delhi polls.

(PTI) It was the winter of 2021 and political parties were getting ready for the Punjab assembly polls when Arvind Kejriwal, chief of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), came out with five guarantees — including crediting Rs 1,000 per month into the account of every woman in the state — if the party wins. Kejriwal promised that all the women in a house, who were above the age of 18 years, would be given Rs 1,000 per month if they registered for the scheme. So, if a house had more than one adult woman, the money would be given to each individual. related stories When elections were held in February 2022, AAP swept the polls with a clear majority, winning 92 of 117 seats. Over time, the party fulfilled all its promises and guarantees. Yet, the promise to women could not be fulfilled, even as the government is set to complete three years in the next few weeks. Speaking to News18, a state party leader said they are well aware that the guarantee is “pending\". “It is not that we have forgotten what we promised. For every scheme that a government implements, a lot of planning is done. The work is underway and very soon, women will start getting the money. We never said we will not do that. We have already fulfilled four guarantees even before completing two years. We are the only party in India that delivers every promise. Soon, we will get the good news for this scheme also,\" the leader said, without getting into the details of the timeline. As against the term ‘promise’ used by political parties and their leaders, AAP opts for the word ‘guarantee’. “When we say guarantee, it means the work will be done, no matter what. As giving money to women was a guarantee, it will also be done,\" the leader added. Even before elections were held in Punjab, Kejriwal had started registrations for the scheme. In May this year, the Bhagwant Mann government said they will give Rs 1,100 to women instead of Rs 1,000 per month. However, in the state budget of 2024-25, no funds were allocated for the scheme. Mann had said his government would redirect funds from other schemes for the payment but nothing concrete has taken shape so far. Punjab Formula Repeated in Delhi What happened in Punjab in 2021-22 is now being repeated by Kejriwal in Delhi where elections are due in February 2025. Though the former chief minister made a similar announcement for women in the national capital, the difference was the scheme did get cleared by the Cabinet though it has a long journey ahead. Apart from other steps, the scheme will also have to get clearance from the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. On Thursday, the Delhi Cabinet cleared the ‘Mahila Samman Yojana’ for the city under which Rs 1,000 per month will be credited to the account of every woman who lives in the national capital and registers for the scheme. While making the announcement, Kejriwal said the cabinet approval is for Rs 1,000, but he will give Rs 2,100 per month to every woman after the elections are over and the party forms the next government. The registration of the scheme will start from Friday, he said, although the amount may only be credited after the formation of the new government. “We announced that we will give Rs 1,000 to every woman every month in their bank accounts. Today, under the leadership of chief minister Atishi, the cabinet cleared the proposal to give Rs 1,000 in every woman’s bank account,\" Kejriwal said. He said with this announcement, the scheme has been launched in Delhi for which women need to register. The initial announcement for the scheme was done in March and Kejriwal said he was expecting the scheme may be launched by May. Addressing the questions raised by the opposition on the freebies provided by his government, Kejriwal said he knows how to get the money, how to manage it and how to spend it. “When I first said electricity will be free, they said the government does not have funds but we did it… people were saying it is not possible. But if Kejriwal decides something, he will do it,\" he said, calling himself a “magician\". top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Kejriwal also said while the scheme has been launched, the money may not be credited to accounts as elections will be announced in the next 10-15 days. “I believe if each and every woman votes for us, we will get at least 60-65 seats in Delhi,\" Kejriwal said.

Sarita Singh, another failed candidate from 2020, has been renamed from Rohtas Nagar. On the remaining 26 seats, the party has trusted new names for the 2025 elections.

In Mangolpuri, councillor Rakesh Jatav Dharamrakshak had been given the chance.

(PTI) The past 10 days have been particularly challenging for Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde. Not only did Shinde face health issues, but he also endured mounting pressure to join the Devendra Fadnavis -led government as Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister. Having served as chief minister for two-and-a-half years, Shinde initially resisted the idea of stepping into a secondary role, citing a preference to focus on strengthening the party’s organisation. Speculation about internal discord within the Mahayuti alliance grew when Shinde retreated to his native village in Satara. However, he returned to Mumbai after a brief hiatus and resumed deliberations with key alliance leaders. The interactions with chief minister-elect Fadnavis at the CM’s official residence, Varsha Bungalow, were pivotal in persuading Shinde to accept the deputy CM role. related stories Fadnavis played a central role in this decision-making process. After staking claim to form the government, Fadnavis visited Shinde at Varsha to urge him to join the cabinet. During their 20-minute meeting, Shinde expressed reservations but was reportedly assured a fair distribution of key portfolios, including the home department, MSRDC, and energy, which are crucial for both governance and his party’s political standing.

I have full faith he will join us.\" Shiv Sena MLAs and former cabinet colleagues also played a significant role in convincing Shinde. Sources indicate that Shinde initially wanted a senior party leader to assume the role of deputy CM. However, persistent demands from MLAs, MPs, and Shiv Sainiks across the state forced him to reconsider. Prominent Shiv Sena leaders emphasised the necessity of Shinde’s participation in the new government to maintain party morale and unity. Party MLA Bharat Gogavale said, “We urged him to be part of the government as this will help both the party and the administration.\" Similarly, Uday Samant pointed out that around 60-61 MLAs, including independents, firmly backed Shinde for the position, reflecting a strong consensus within the party.

Accepting the deputy chief minister role would reinforce Shiv Sena’s presence in the government and ensure the party’s interests remain safeguarded. However, it also risked being perceived as a step down after his tenure as chief minister. Declining the post, on the other hand, could weaken Shiv Sena’s influence within the Mahayuti alliance and jeopardise its future political prospects. Shinde’s decision to join the Fadnavis-led government as deputy chief minister is a significant moment in Maharashtra’s political landscape. It ensures Shiv Sena’s continued relevance within the ruling coalition and reinforces Shinde’s leadership within the party. The assurances of a fair portfolio distribution also underline the importance of maintaining coalition harmony while addressing internal demands. As Maharashtra embarks on this new chapter under the Mahayuti government, Shinde’s role will remain crucial in shaping governance and political dynamics in the state. tags : Devendra Fadnavis eknath shinde Home Ministry mahayuti news18 specials Location : Mumbai, India First Published: December 05, 2024, 09:54 IST News elections How Fadnavis Got Eknath Shinde To Accept Deputy CM Role In Just 20 Minutes | Inside Story Read More",

(PTI) “I am like the ocean; I will return\"— Devendra Fadnavis has often cited this line since 2019 when he was virtually robbed of the chief minister’s chair by Uddhav Thackeray, who switched camps to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi. Even in 2022, when the Mahayuti returned to power, Fadnavis had to contend with a “demotion\" to deputy CM. This got him constant taunts from Uddhav Thackeray and his party, which often described Fadnavis as being outdone by the political chakravyuh. Supriya Sule of the NCP often took potshots, saying, “What can one Fadnavis do alone?\" The 2024 Lok Sabha election debacle for the Mahayuti in Maharashtra was also laid on the door of Fadnavis, as the BJP fared badly under his leadership. It seemed to many that the Fadnavis story was over, and his competitors in the BJP believed so. related stories But in the mother of all comebacks, Fadnavis has led the BJP to its best-ever performance in Maharashtra with 132 seats at a phenomenal 85% strike rate just six months later. He has also reclaimed the CM’s chair. “Main modern Abhimanyu hun, main chakravyuh todna bhi janta hun, aur jitna bhi janta hun (I am a modern Abhimanyu who knows how to breach the chakravyuh and win),\" was the favourite poll slogan of Fadnavis during the election campaign. ALSO READ | Eknath Shinde Agrees To Deputy CM Role, But 2 Key Posts Remain Sticking Points: Sources Many in the BJP also attribute it to Fadnavis’s strategy that the Shiv Sena and NCP splits happened in Maharashtra over the past two and a half years. While Fadnavis always said these parties broke up due to their patriarchs preferring their sons or daughters over the more deserving candidates, one cannot discount the fact that the BJP leader was silently chipping away at these conflicts. Ultimately, he has humbled both Uddhav and Supriya Sule. Fadnavis is also among the handful of leaders in the BJP whom both PM Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat have a fondness for. Fadnavis always had an ace up his sleeve—the RSS. Born into a family deeply entrenched in the Sangh ideology, he began his political journey with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, which is the student wing of the RSS. His father’s strong and unwavering association with the organisation further cemented his image as a loyal swayamsevak, a factor seen as crucial and significant in navigating Maharashtra’s politically volatile and sensitive landscape. This is a relationship that Fadnavis has nurtured over the years, including seeking the RSS’s help against “vote jihad\" after the Lok Sabha results went against the BJP. Soon after the polling was over in Maharashtra, Fadnavis dutifully paid a visit to Bhagwat at the RSS headquarters to thank the RSS for its groundwork in the polls. The RSS subsequently made it clear to the BJP that Fadnavis was its choice for the CM after the BJP had secured a record 132 seats.

It was under Fadnavis’s watch as CM till 2019 that big infrastructure projects like the Samruddhi Mahamarg from Nagpur to Mumbai were envisioned and launched.

When the crucial moment came in 2022 to make a “sacrifice\" for the sake of loyalty towards his party discipline, Fadnavis slipped into the deputy CM role without any complaints and waited for his turn. This was something that has endeared Fadnavis even more to PM Modi. In the entire election campaign, and even after the big win, Fadnavis did not lay claim to the CM’s chair and left it to the Prime Minister.

The hour-long meeting’s details remain unclear, with political observers interpreting it in various ways.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani, designated as central observers for the BJP legislature party meeting, will arrive in Mumbai on late on Tuesday.

My health is in good condition,\" he told reporters while leaving the hospital. A doctor said Shinde had throat issues. “The CM had a fever and infection, which caused weakness. He also underwent an MRI scan as a precautionary measure,\" he said. Shinde, whose party, Shiv Sena, is a constituent of the BJP-led Mahayuti coalition, has been unwell for the last few days. His decision to head to his village in Satara district last week had sparked speculation that he was unhappy over the way the new government was shaping up. There are indications that the distribution of portfolios among the three allies might not be a smooth process. Sena leaders on Monday said as per the “convention\" of alliance politics, their party should get the home portfolio if the CM post went to the BJP.

(Representational image/PTI) Riding high on its success in last month’s Uttar Pradesh by-elections , where it secured seven out of nine seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party has now set its sights on Mission Milkipur. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed ministers and party functionaries to intensify poll preparations and electorate mobilisation in Ayodhya’s significant Milkipur constituency that is gearing up for bypolls. While the BJP plans to emphasise Hindu unity with slogans like “Batenge toh katenge\" (If we are divided, we’ll be slaughtered), the Samajwadi Party aims to retain its stronghold with its “Picchda Dalit Alpsankhyak\" (PDA) strategy. The Milkipur by-election, political analysts say, is no less than a prestige battle for the BJP, especially after it lost the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat to the Samajwadi Party in the April-June general elections. The saffron party is eyeing this Dalit-dominated assembly seat to avenge its defeat. And it is the main reason why the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government is in no mood to take any chances. Party sources say that Mission Milkipur was the second most discussed issue after the 2025 Mahakumbh in the meeting of the council of ministers held recently at the UP CM’s residence. related stories Kundarki formula “Yogiji has directed party functionaries to camp in Milkipur, stay connected with the people, and make the masses aware of schemes and development work carried out by the BJP government,\" a senior party leader said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath told his ministers to apply the “Kundarki formula\", where people from all sections of society supported the BJP in the byelections, helping the party win the seat after a gap of 31 years. “The ministers were told to reach out to all sections of the society, as the party did in Kundarki, and make sure that they get support from the people from all the communities, irrespective of caste and religion,\" the senior leader said. The BJP managed a decisive victory in the Muslim-dominated Kundarki seat in Moradabad, traditionally an SP stronghold. BJP’s Ramveer Thakur won by a margin of over 1.4 lakh, defeating his closest rival, three-time MLA and SP candidate Haji Rizwan, whose bail amount was confiscated. Ramveer secured 1,44,791 votes, while Rizwan got a mere 25,580 votes. Singh, being the only Hindu candidate from the Muslim-dominated seat, created history. UP’s political observers said a split in Muslim votes was the main reason behind the BJP’s win. “BJP’s Ramveer Thakur was the lone Hindu candidate from Kundarki, while others, including the SP, all fielded Muslims. The data from the Election Commission of India clearly indicates a split in Muslim votes, which led to the BJP’s victory and the downfall of the SP candidate. SP’s Mohammad Rizwan got 25,580 votes, Azad Samaj Party’s Chand Babu got 14,201 votes, Bahujan Samaj Party’s Rafatulla got 1,099 votes, while there were seven other independent Muslim candidates,\" said Shashikant Pandey, political observer and head of the department of political science, Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow. Date to be announced A bypoll is due in Milkipur, which falls in Ayodhya on the borders of Amethi and Sultanpur, after its MLA, Awadhesh Prasad, got elected as an MP from Faizabad (Ayodhya). While announcing last month’s bypolls for 10 vacant assembly seats of UP, the Election Commission of India (ECI) skipped Milkipur following a writ petition filed by BJP candidate Baba Gorakhnath, who contested the 2022 assembly elections from the seat. Baba Gorakhnath challenged the victory of Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate Awadhesh Prasad, raising concerns over the authenticity of the documents submitted during his nomination. The withdrawal of his petition paved the way for the bypolls in Milkipur. However, the Election Commission has yet to announce the poll schedule for Milkipur. While the SP has announced the candidature of Awadhesh Prasad’s son Ajit from the constituency, the BJP is yet to announce any candidate from Milkipur.

If all goes well, Parvesh Sahib Singh’s name is likely to be pushed as the BJP candidate from Kejriwal’s New Delhi constituency. A former MP from West Delhi and the son of former CM the late Sahib Singh Verma, Singh is believed to have been signalled to make preparations for his electoral comeback in a meeting between the functionaries of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Delhi BJP at Rajasthan’s Ranthambore. If it gets past the BJP’s Central Election Committee (CEC), it will turn out to be an interesting fight. In 2020, Singh had called Kejriwal a “terrorist\". “In Delhi, many ‘Natwarlals’ and terrorists like Kejriwal are hiding. I don’t understand if we should fight with terrorists in Kashmir or with terrorist Kejriwal in Delhi,\" he had said back then. The former legislator had also taken to social media platforms to compare Kejriwal to coronavirus in 2020, when the world was waking up to its deadly ramifications. Last time, the BJP had pitted lightweight Sunil Yadav, whom the AAP chief had crushed. LEKHI VS ATISHI? The BJP may turn south Delhi’s Kalkaji fight into an all-women’s contest, with Meenakshi Lekhi in the fray. Atishi is a Rhodes scholar who joined as an adviser to Manish Sisodia and made her way to the top seat in the government. Lekhi started her career as a lawyer and has been vocal about women’s issues. Part of the drafting committee of the Women’s Reservation Bill, Lekhi rose from the party’s women’s wing to become a name to reckon with in the South Block under S Jaishankar. Both Lekhi and Atishi are known to be animated speakers, with expertise in handling public grievances. However, unlike many politicians, neither treads towards verbal indecency. While the CEC can change names, in case of a Lekhi vs Atishi fight, two things are guaranteed — minimal personal attacks and more attacks on the party bosses they represent. THE PROCESS The BJP sends three names for each constituency — be it for the assembly or Lok Sabha — for the CEC to pick from. Familiar sources say that even seats of Kejriwal and Atishi will have three BJP options. BJP’s Delhi election in-charge and national vice-president Jay Panda, co-incharge and Ghaziabad MP Atul Garg, and state president Virendra Sachdeva, among others, will decide the best-suited candidate. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The BJP has been saying that no meeting has taken place. “We are going to the residential areas. No such meetings have taken place as of today. It is still early,\" Sachdeva told News18. Calls and text messages to Panda’s phone went unanswered. However, sources say the BJP has had meetings on the Delhi elections and the first list could be out after the CEC’s stamp of approval before mid-December. News18 has also learnt that the first list could contain 35-40 names. The date of the CEC will depend upon the availability of the Prime Minister. tags : Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) arvind kejriwal atishi bharatiya janata party bjp delhi elections meenakshi lekhi news18 specials Location : New Delhi, India First Published: December 03, 2024, 13:23 IST News elections Here’s Who BJP May Field Against AAP’s Kejriwal, Atishi In Delhi Polls | Exclusive Read More",

(Dnyaneshwar Saolkhe/News18)The villagers proposed holding a trial election on December 3 and even assured the administration that they would bear the entire cost but the administration rejected the request. (Dnyaneshwar Saolkhe/News18) Markadwadi, a small village in Malshiras taluka, has turned into a fortress as residents announced plans to hold unauthorised ballot paper voting on Tuesday after the local leader received fewer votes from the village compared to the BJP candidate in the recently concluded Maharashtra assembly elections. The local administration, concerned about law and order, has imposed Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code, prohibiting gatherings in the village from December 2-5. related stories The unrest began when villagers expressed distrust in electronic voting machines (EVMs) and declared their intention to hold a ballot-based election to challenge the official results of the Maharashtra polls. The administration has strictly warned that any attempt to conduct the ballot voting will lead to legal action. Markadwadi’s election officer and Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO), Vijaya Pangarkar, issued the order to enforce Section 144, citing fears of public unrest. The notification clarified that any violation, including attempts to organise unauthorised voting, would attract criminal charges under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. “The villagers cannot conduct any voting process independently. Elections, as per Indian law, are solely under the jurisdiction of the Election Commission. Any violation of this law will result in strict action,\" Pangarkar stated in the notice. Amid growing tensions, Markadwadi has transformed into a police stronghold. Large contingents of law enforcement have been stationed in the area to maintain peace and prevent any disruptions. The heavy police presence aims to deter villagers from proceeding with their ballot voting plans. The situation escalated as the administration urged villagers to cancel their plans, stating that no government staff would be provided for conducting such an election. Despite these warnings, villagers initially held a meeting to finalise their preparations though the imposition of Section 144 has added significant pressure. The controversy stems from allegations by a group of villagers supporting local leader Uttam Jankar. In the recently concluded assembly elections, Jankar reportedly received only 843 votes, compared to 1,003 votes for the BJP candidate, Ram Satpute. Though Jankar won from the region, his supporters claim that the village historically delivered 80 per cent of its votes to him in past elections, including the Lok Sabha polls held earlier this year. They demanded an independent re-vote using ballot papers to verify their claims. The villagers proposed holding a trial election on December 3 and even assured the administration that they would bear the entire cost. They submitted a written request to the tehsildar, asking for government officials to oversee the process. However, the administration rejected the request, citing legal and procedural constraints. Despite the administration’s firm stance, many villagers remain determined to proceed with the ballot voting. A section of the community believes that this alternative election is the only way to prove their claims of irregularities. Tensions in the village have heightened due to disagreements between Jankar’s supporters and opposition groups. Some villagers, opposing the re-vote, have accused Jankar’s group of acting without consulting the entire community and warned that they would boycott any such election. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all This is not the first time Markadwadi has been embroiled in election controversies. In previous elections, supporters of Jankar have raised concerns about voting discrepancies. However, the administration has consistently maintained that all official elections are conducted transparently, with no evidence of malpractice. The current dispute marks an unprecedented escalation, as villagers attempt to take matters into their own hands. For now, all eyes are on Markadwadi as the administration’s strict imposition of Section 144 and heavy police deployment are expected to deter any attempts to conduct the ballot voting. tags : BJP EVMs maharashtra election Location : ...",

(PTI) Maharashtra Government Formation: The wait for Maharashtra’s next Chief Minister continues as Mahayuti parties are yet to decide the allocation of key portfolios, ahead of the oath-taking ceremony on December 5 in Mumbai. While Eknath Shinde’s earlier stand cleared the way for a BJP CM to take the helm, another day went by without any official announcement. All eyes are now on the key BJP legislative meeting tomorrow (December 4) at 10 am at Maharashtra Vidhan Bhavan, where the party is expected to announce their pick as the next CM face of Maharashtra, weeks after the Mahayuti alliance won a thumping victory over the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). related stories Notably, BJP has already announced that the oath-taking ceremony will take place on the evening of December 5 at Azad Maidan, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top leaders. NCP leader Ajit Pawar is currently in Delhi for talks on government formation. What To Expect On December 4? The BJP is holding a legislative party meeting tomorrow, where it is expected to announce its Legislature Party Leader and the CM face of Maharashtra. This comes as the state unit of the BJP announced that the oath-taking ceremony of the Mahayuti government will take place on December 5 evening, much to the shock of the Shinde Sena. Following the election of the BJP legislature party leader, the name of the Maharashtra CM is expected to be announced in the meeting. Meanwhile, preparations for the oath-taking ceremony are in full swing at Azad Maidan, according to Maharashtra BJP President Chandrashekhar Bawankule. Devendra Fadnavis’ name has been finalised as the new CM of Maharashtra, a senior BJP leader told news agency PTI on Sunday. The two-time CM was widely seen as a frontrunner for the top post after the landslide Mahayuti victory. Another BJP source told CNN-News18 that Maharashtra caretaker CM Eknath Shinde is likely to be appointed as Deputy Chief Minister. Ajit Pawar Reaches Delhi For Govt Formation Talks NCP leader Ajit Pawar has reached Delhi to meet BJP’s top leadership for talks over government formation. He is likely to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah for the second time within a week to discuss the formula of distribution of Cabinet berths and allocation of ministries. While the Ajit Pawar faction has thrown its weight behind a CM from the BJP, the three parties are locked in tense negotiations over power-sharing in the cabinet, with Shinde seeking the home ministry vital for maintaining law and order, much to BJP’s reluctance, while NCP gunning for the finance ministry. Shinde, Ajit Pawar and Fadnavis had planned to meet on Friday to huddle over government formation but it was put on hold after Shinde flew to his native village in Satara district after feeling unwell. He said discussions would resume on Monday, but today’s meeting was also cancelled. Devendra Fadnavis Dials Shinde Amid Ill-Health Eknath Shinde on Monday cancelled all his appointments and meetings after doctors advised him to take rest, as he is recovering from ill-health in his hometown Satara. Following this, today’s Mahayuti meeting was cancelled and Devendra Fadnavis called Shinde to check on his health. On his return to Thane on Sunday, Eknath Shinde had reiterated that the BJP, which won 132 seats in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, will take the final call on the next CM of the state, ruling out any differences within the alliance over the government formation. Shinde said he would discuss power-sharing talks with Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar. Shiv Sena legislators earlier made a unanimous decision to elect Eknath Shinde as the legislative party group leader, while NCP legislators chose Ajit Pawar for the same position. Eknath Shinde’s Son Rules Out Deputy CM Post Reports have floated that Eknath Shinde is pushing for his son Shrikant in the deputy CM position once the main leader is finalised. However, Shrikant Shinde put to rest all rumours suggesting that he would be nominated as the deputy CM, calling such reports “false and baseless\". In a post on X, Shrikant Shinde said he had the chance of becoming a Union Cabinet minister after the Lok Sabha polls but denied it as he wanted to focus on working for the party’s organisation and his constituency. “I have no desire for a position of power. I make it clear once again that I am not in the race for any ministerial position in the state,\" he said, while urging the media to refrain from “distorting facts\".

(PTI) Eknath Shinde seems to be exploring his options to strike a favourable deal with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) amid speculations that he may give up claim to the chief minister’s chair in exchange for influential portfolios. Among Shinde’s demands, his insistence on securing the home ministry has gained attention, given his long-standing interest in the portfolio. The home ministry is seen as a critical department, overseeing the police force and playing a vital role in managing the state’s law and order. Shinde’s affinity for the ministry has been well-known within Shiv Sena circles for years. related stories In 2019, when the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and Congress formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, it was clear that Uddhav Thackeray would take the chief minister’s post. At that time, Shinde was keen to bag the home ministry. However, the power-sharing arrangement assigned the home ministry to the NCP. As compensation, the urban development portfolio went to the Shiv Sena, and Shinde was appointed its minister. While urban development is an important department, it does not wield the same political weight as the home ministry. ALSO READ | Experience, Hat-Trick Of 100+ Seats, Tricky Alliance: Why BJP Cadre Is Rooting For Fadnavis As CM In June 2022, Shinde led a rebellion that split the Shiv Sena, ousted the MVA government, and formed a new alliance with the BJP. After becoming chief minister, he once again expressed interest in the home ministry. However, his deputy chief minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis retained the portfolio for the BJP, ensuring the party’s control over one of the state’s most powerful departments. Now, as the BJP reportedly looks to reclaim the chief minister’s post, Shinde is again pushing to secure the home ministry as part of the ongoing power-sharing negotiations. The home ministry is the second-most influential position in the cabinet after the chief minister. The minister in charge directly oversees the police force, giving them significant leverage in political strategy, particularly in handling opposition parties and rivals. Though the chief minister already has indirect control over the home ministry, as all major decisions require the chief minister’s approval, direct control over the department offers strategic and political advantages. Senior police officers and home department officials also report to the chief minister on critical matters, ensuring that the CM remains in the loop. However, Shinde’s push for the home ministry reflects his desire to consolidate power. With political rivals like Uddhav Thackeray and other opposition leaders continuing to challenge him, Shinde’s demand for this portfolio highlights his intent to strengthen his position within the government. The home ministry has become a focal point of contention between Shinde and Fadnavis, reflecting the larger power struggle within the Mahayuti government. While Shinde leads the coalition as chief minister, the BJP remains the dominant partner. Many BJP legislators believe that Shinde’s insistence on the home ministry stems from his understanding of the portfolio’s political significance. This ongoing tug-of-war is not limited to the home ministry. Shinde is also reportedly eyeing other influential portfolios, including public works, revenue, industries, and the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). These departments oversee major infrastructure and development projects in the state, offering opportunities for visibility and influence.

It allows the party to maintain direct control over law enforcement, a significant advantage in both governance and politics.

For Shinde, securing influential departments is vital for his political survival.

(PTI) In the BJP, nothing is considered done till it is done. That is why even senior BJP leaders say “almost\" when asked if Devendra Fadnavis is final as the next chief minister of Maharashtra. But for the BJP rank and file in the state, the choice of ‘Deva Bhau’, as Fadnavis is fondly addressed by the party cadre, is a no-brainer. For starters, it is now clear that the chief minister will be from BJP. Ajit Pawar on Saturday said it will be a BJP CM, with deputy CMs from his party and the Shiv Sena. Eknath Shinde on Sunday said the CM face question will be answered when BJP chooses its leader at the legislature party meeting. But they did not answer who the chief minister will be. related stories The BJP has also not said so while announcing the oath-taking on December 5, leaving the decision to the protocol of having a legislature party meeting that will happen on Monday or Tuesday in the presence of senior observers from the Centre. Hat-Trick Under Fadnavis Amongst the BJP cadre in the state, the choice is just one — Devendra Fadnavis. Multiple BJP leaders that News18 spoke to over the last week cite clear reasons. “This is a leader who has delivered a hat-trick of 100+ seats for the BJP — 122 in 2014 when he led the campaign as the BJP state president, 102 seats in 2019, and now a record 132 seats. He has experience of leading the state as the chief minister from 2014 till 2019. This is the country’s richest and economically most important state and needs an experienced hand,\" a senior BJP leader said. Tricky Alliance Another reason cited by the BJP cadre for the mantle to be given to Fadnavis is the management of a tricky complicated alliance. With Fadnavis possibly exchanging places with Shinde in the CM-deputy CM equation, and Ajit Pawar continuing as the deputy CM, the power alignments will change in Mahayuti and an inexperienced leader at the top may not be able to manage the egos of his deputies. Given that Ajit Pawar’s party is not said to be that fond of Eknath Shinde’s party, and the former has already rooted for Fadnavis, the BJP knows who to put in charge. Contenders Deny BJP leaders and the Shinde camp have also rubbished the speculation that Shinde had asked the BJP leadership to not make Fadnavis the chief minister. “No such discussion ever happened,\" a senior Shiv Sena leader told News18. Two other BJP leaders, Murlidhar Mohol and Ravindra Chavan, whose names were speculated as CM choices, have publicly dismissed such speculation, crediting Fadnavis for the win. In fact, senior BJP leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe met Fadnavis on Sunday and in a statement credited him for “his leadership that saw BJP scoring highest number of seats in assembly elections consecutively for the third time\", Sahasrabuddhe said. Age On His Side, Discipline At 54, Fadnavis is also a young leader with full support from the RSS, making him the clear frontrunner. Senior BJP leaders who were denied the opportunity last year to be chief ministers — like Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Vasundhara Raje and Raman Singh — had all been multiple-time CMs of their respective states. “At one call of the party leadership in 2022 and following party discipline, Fadnavis had agreed to become the deputy CM under Eknath Shinde after earlier being chief minister for five years,\" a BJP leader said. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Home Minister Amit Shah is said to have politely told Shinde the same when the caretaker CM asked if it would be abrupt for him to now become the deputy CM after being the CM. Making Fadnavis the chief minister is important to keep the BJP cadre motivated as the sentiment of the cadre is for Fadnavis. “Unless the party wishes to make Fadnavis the BJP national president next year, there seems to be no other way than him becoming the chief minister,\" a senior BJP leader in Maharashtra told News18.

The AAP and Congress had attempted to forge an alliance in Haryana, however, the seat-sharing talks did not yield any conclusion. Kejriwal’s decision also comes on the back of major poll drubbing of the Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra this month, which Congress is also a part of, drawing criticism from its allies. Congress-AAP Alliance In Lok Sabha Polls The Congress and AAP had contested the Lok Sabha Elections this year in Delhi in alliance with each other under the umbrella of the INDIA bloc. Both parties had even campaigned for each other. Kejriwal, who was then out on interim bail for the election campaigning, had also campaigned for the Congress and had sought votes for its Opposition party (in the Delhi Assembly). AAP had contested on 4 seats while Congress on 3 seats out of 7 parliamentary constituencies in Delhi. However, neither of the two parties could open the account as the BJP swept all 7 seats in the city. However, in contrast to Delhi, the AAP had contested all 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab on its own, ditching the Congress in the state. The AAP is in power in Punjab with a huge majority. In 2022 Assembly polls in Punjab, the Kejriwal-led party had swept the state winning 92 out of the 117 seats, dislodging Congress from power.

This is the same situation of the INDIA bloc everywhere, but they show friendship in Delhi. They have a system of friendship with benefits,\" he added.
