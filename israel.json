The move comes only two days after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect in the Gaza Strip.The Israeli military said on Jan. 21 its forces along with Shin Bet and border police had launched an operation dubbed \"Iron Wall\" in Jenin. Israeli PM Netanyahu described the operation as \"large and significant\" which he said is aimed to \"eradicate terrorism.” Netanyahu said the raid was also part of a broader strategy to counter Iran \"wherever it sends its arms -- in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen\" and the West Bank.The Israeli government has accused Iran of attempting to send weapons and money to militants in the West Bank. The Palestinian Red Crescent said that Israeli forces were hindering their access to the area. Meanwhile, Israeli NGO B'Tselem accused the government of using the Gaza ceasefire as \"an opportunity to ratchet up the oppression of West Bank Palestinians.\" n18oc_world n18oc_crux0:00 INTRODUCTION2:28 “AN INVASION OF THE CAMP”5:18 HAMAS CALLS FOR 'MOBILISATION' IN WEST BANK7:14 TRUMP’S UN ENVOY BACKS SMOTRICH’S VIEWS ON WEST BANK",

Washington: President Donald Trump has instructed the US military to release a hold imposed by former President Joe Biden on the supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, a White House source told Reuters on Saturday. The move was widely expected. Biden put a hold on the delivery of those bombs due to concern over the impact they could have on the civilian population, particularly in Gaza's Rafah, during Israel's war in the Palestinian enclave. \"A lot of things that were ordered and paid for by Israel, but have not been sent by Biden, are now on their way!\" Trump said on the Truth Social media platform without providing further details. Trump and Biden have been strong supporters of US ally Israel, even as Washington has come under criticism from human rights advocates over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from Israel's military assault against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Protesters have unsuccessfully demanded an arms embargo. A ceasefire went into effect a week ago and has led to the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Before his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump had warned there would be \"hell to pay\" if hostages held by Hamas in Gaza were not released. Hamas took around 250 hostages during an Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli tallies. It sparked the latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed more than 47,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies. It also displaced nearly Gaza's entire population and caused a hunger crisis. Washington says it is helping Israel defend against Iran-backed militant groups like Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.

Three hostages and 90 prisoners were released on Sunday, when it took effect. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek an independent state encompassing all three territories. The ceasefire does not apply to the West Bank, which has seen a surge of violence since the start of the war. Israeli troops have carried out near-daily raids that often ignite gunbattles. There has also been a rise in attacks on Palestinians by Jewish extremists — including a rampage in two Palestinian villages overnight Monday — as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis. Hamas condemned the Israeli operation in Jenin, calling on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to step up their own attacks. The smaller and more radical Islamic Jihad militant group also condemned the operation, saying it reflected Israel’s “failure to achieve its goals in Gaza.\" It said it was also a “desperate attempt\" by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to save his governing coalition. Netanyahu has faced criticism from his far-right allies over the ceasefire, which required Israeli troops to pull back from populated areas in Gaza and envisions the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including militants convicted of involvement in deadly attacks on Israelis. The ceasefire has already seen Hamas return to the streets, showing that it remains in firm control of the territory despite 15 months of war that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread devastation. One of his erstwhile partners, Itamar Ben-Gvir, quit the government the day the ceasefire went into effect, weakening the coalition but still leaving Netanyahu with a parliamentary majority. Another, far-right leader, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to bolt if Israel does not resume the war after the first phase of the ceasefire ends in six weeks. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. More than 90 captives are still being held in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities but do not say how many of the dead were fighters.

      "full_content": "Who In Israel Has Resigned Over The Oct 7 Security Breakdown, And Who Hasn't? Published By : News Desk Associated Press Last Updated: January 21, 2025, 23:50 IST Netanyahu, who was prime minister for all but one of the 14 years leading up to the attack, has not taken responsibility. reset Follow us on Google News Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu (AP Image) Israel’s top general on Tuesday became the highest-ranking official to resign over Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, the worst security failure in the country’s history. Like much of Israel’s top brass, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi remained in his post through the 15-month war in the Gaza Strip, the related conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon and tensions with Iran that led the two countries to exchange fire twice last year. related stories But days into a ceasefire with Hamas, and with the other conflicts having wound down, he and the head of Israel’s Southern Command, which oversees operations in Gaza, announced they would step down. Their resignations are likely to fuel longstanding calls in Israel for a public inquiry into the security and intelligence failures of Oct. 7. That could implicate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has insisted that such an investigation can only be held after the war. Here’s a look at who has taken the fall for Oct. 7 and who hasn’t. Netanyahu, who was prime minister for all but one of the 14 years leading up to the attack, has not taken responsibility. He says he is among several officials who should face tough questions but that any public inquiry must wait until the end of the war. His critics say he bears responsibility, not only for the failure to prevent the attack, but for his longstanding policy of trying to contain Hamas in Gaza. That included allowing Qatar to deliver large amounts of financial aid — some of it in suitcases of cash — to the territory in exchange for calm. Netanyahu has sought to reframe his legacy during the war, boasting of unprecedented achievements against Iran and its militant allies across the region. He has vowed to keep fighting until all the hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 attack are returned and Hamas has been dismantled. Netanyahu fired his popular defense minister in November, citing differences over the conduct of the war and replacing him with a loyalist. Gallant — who has long called for a public inquiry into the Oct. 7 failures — emerged as one of Israel’s more popular leaders during the war, in part by prioritizing a hostage deal over the annihilation of Hamas in the last months of his tenure. In announcing his resignation, Halevi acknowledged his responsibility for the military’s failure on Oct. 7 and said he would ensure its internal investigations into the attack would be completed before leaving his role on March 6. Bar has led the agency, which is tasked with collecting intelligence on Palestinians, since 2021. He took responsibility for the failure to thwart the attack just days after it occurred but has not resigned, saying investigations into what happened would need to come after the war. Barnea would likely bear less responsibility for the Oct. 7 failures, as the Mossad is tasked with spying on enemies outside the territories Israel controls. He was a leading negotiator in more than a year of indirect talks with Hamas that led to this month’s ceasefire. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all In his letter of resignation, Finkelman said his failure to defend southern Israel on Oct. 7 “will be etched into me for the rest of my life.\" Haliva resigned in April, saying his directorate had not lived up to its mission on Oct. 7. “I carry that black day with me ever since, day after day, night after night. I will carry the horrible pain of the war with me forever,\" he wrote in his resignation letter.

As a fragile six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas entered its sixth day, Israelis waited anxiously for the names of the next four hostages who will be released from among the more than 90 still held in Gaza. related stories In the Palestinian enclave, civilians in the central and southern part of the Gaza Strip hoping to return to the remnants of their home in the battered north faced an agonizing wait. Israel believes about a third, or possibly as many as half, of the more than 90 hostages still in Gaza have died. Hamas has not released definitive information on how many captives are still alive or the names of those who have died. “Dear President Trump, first of all we want to say thank you for the happy moments we felt this week. But we want to tell you we still have 94 hostages, we need them all at home,\" said Ayelet Samerano, whose son Yonatan Samerano is among those still being held. “Please do not stop. Please continue to press and do everything so that all the 94 hostages will come home immediately.\" In the first phase of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages are expected to be released gradually in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The first three Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, the first day of the ceasefire that has halted the 15-month war that has devastated Gaza. Wide swathes of the territory have been destroyed, while more than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not differentiate between combatants and civilians but say more than half are women and children. According to the deal, on Friday Hamas is to announce the names of the next four hostages to be released on Saturday, after which Israel will also release a list of which Palestinian prisoners will be freed. The hostages were among about 250 men, women and children captured by militants who burst across the border into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people in an attack that sparked the war in Gaza. About 100 were released during a brief ceasefire in November that year, while the bodies of around three dozen hostages have been recovered in Gaza and eight hostages have been rescued by the army. “I call from here to the Prime Minister and negotiating team — you’re doing excellent work — do whatever is necessary to bring everyone back, to the last hostage,\" Samerano said. “We ask you to ensure phase two of the deal is agreed upon before finishing the current phrase. We cannot continue living in uncertainty. All hostages must return, and none of them has time left.\" The 33 to be released in the first phase will include women, children, sick people and those over 50 — almost all civilians, though the deal also commits Hamas to freeing all living female soldiers in Phase 1. Hamas will release living hostages first, but could release some bodies if they don’t have enough living hostages in this category. Male soldiers are not expected to be released in the first phase. “This week we were moved to watch images of mothers embracing their daughters, but our hearts break thinking that my son Nimrod and other men remain behind, and each day they’re there poses a real danger to their lives,\" said Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod Cohen is among the hostages. “The worry that the deal won’t be fully implemented gnaws at us all. All senior officials openly say that stopping the deal means a death sentence for those left behind.\" Under the terms of the deal, Palestinians in Gaza will have more freedom of movement from the north to the south of the enclave. Civilians in the south will be allowed to take a coastal road to northern Gaza from Saturday, when Israeli troops are expected to withdraw from the key route and Hamas is set to release the next four Israeli hostages. Those in other parts of the strip seized on the ceasefire this week to reunite with scattered family members, picking their way through vast swaths of rubble and trying to salvage what remained of their homes and their belongings. But those displaced from the north have had to wait. “The first thing I’ll do, I’ll kiss the dirt of the land on which I was born and raised,\" said Nadia Al-Debs, one of the many people gathered in makeshift tents in Gaza’s...",

      "full_content": "Israel's War Goal Remains Unmet As Hamas Reclaims Gaza’s Streets Published By : Aveek Banerjee AFP Last Updated: January 23, 2025, 00:07 IST Despite Israel unleashing a fierce bombardment of Gaza that left most of the territory in ruins, Hamas appears to have survived, dealing a blow to Netanyahu's war objectives. reset Follow us on Google News Israel's deadly campaign flattened most of Gaza and killed more than 46,000 Palestinians. (AFP) After more than a year hiding in tunnels and dodging air strikes, uniformed Hamas fighters returned to the ruined streets of Gaza hours into a ceasefire, defying Israel’s vow to crush them. With the world watching on Sunday as Hamas handed over three Israeli hostages to the Red Cross, dozens of balaclava-wearing fighters in the group’s signature green headbands were seen at the packed Gaza City square marshalling the chaotic events. related stories The day after, Hamas’s deputy interior minister for the territory was out and about in Gaza City, declaring that Gazans were “living in a moment of victory\". While Hamas was back on the streets, Israeli forces were withdrawing from the territory’s densely populated areas. The destruction they left behind was staggering, yet Hamas appears to have survived, in spite of Israel’s stated objective from the outset of the war of eradicating the group once and for all. “When you set yourself complete elimination (as a goal), if there is one man standing it can be regarded as failure,\" said Yossi Mekelberg, a Middle East expert at Chatham House. Hamas Experienced ‘Fiercest Bombardment’, Still Recruiting This could prove a problem for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who pledged in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel to destroy the group. “They were under the fiercest bombardment that such an organisation could ever sustain and they are still there and they are still recruiting,\" Mekelberg said. Israel decimated Hamas’s ranks and killed many of its top leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh and his successor Yahya Sinwar. On Tuesday, Israel’s army chief said its campaign had killed “nearly 20,000 Hamas operatives\". Mekelberg cautioned that it was too early to assess Hamas’s overall condition, and acknowledged it had suffered heavy losses, but “on your TV, you see that they are still there, with their bandanas and all their masks\". Muhammad Shehada, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel had specifically targeted civil servants, police and ministers, as part of its efforts to dismantle Hamas’s governing ability. “The continued presence of these officials and forces represents a symbol of defiance, showing they remain operational despite the onslaught,\" he said. On Monday, Hamas presented itself as triumphant for having survived, saying in a statement that “Gaza, with its great people and its resilience, will rise again to rebuild what the occupation has destroyed and continue on the path of steadfastness until the occupation is defeated\". Israel Stuck In Game Of ‘Whack-A-Mole’ The ceasefire is in its infancy and many questions remain about the future of the Gaza Strip and Hamas. Michael Horowitz, a Middle East analyst at the security consultancy Le Beck, said Hamas had made a show of strength both to deter rivals within the Palestinian ranks and to show Israel “that any additional rounds of fighting won’t lead anywhere\". That Hamas was not defeated was down to “one key reason\", he said, namely that Israel “hasn’t tried to replace Hamas as a governing entity in Gaza\". Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority have no role in the Gaza Strip. This “solely security-focused\" vision, said Horowitz, meant “Israel has been stuck in a game of whack-a-mole\". Eva Koulouriotis, an independent Middle East analyst, said Hamas retained “overwhelming popularity\" in Gaza, while “attempts… to provide a popular base for the Palestinian Authority and to reject Hamas’s rule have failed\". The destruction brought by the war did breed resentment towards Hamas among Gazans, said Shehada, but many were conflicted. People “also feel a sense of pride\" that Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, defied Israel’s might, he noted. “It revolves around the fact that people have been humiliated… And then it brings a source of pride\". The humanitarian cost of the war for the people of Gaza has been immense. The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory has put the death toll at more than 47,100, the majority civilians, figures the UN considers reliable. That devastation was in retaliation for Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures. Horowitz said the scale of destruction was among the worst of any urban battle in recent memory, adding it eclipsed the damage done to Mosul in Iraq during the campaign to dislodge the Islamic State group. top videos View all Swipe Left ...",
