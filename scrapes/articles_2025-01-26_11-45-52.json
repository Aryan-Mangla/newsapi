According to sources, Mumbai Police had sent the fingerprints found at Mr Khan's home to the fingerprint bureau of the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID). A system-generated report has established that the prints do not match Shariful's. The CID, sources said, has informed the Mumbai Police that the test result is negative. Mumbai Police has sent more samples for further testing. The 54-year-old actor suffered six stab injuries in a shocking attack on January 15 after an intruder broke into his home. When Mr Khan confronted the intruder, the latter attacked him with a knife. One of the stab injuries Mr Khan suffered was on his spine. The intruder managed to escape and Mr Khan was rushed to Lilavati Hospital with serious injuries. Doctors have said one of the knife injuries was on the actor's spine and had caused his spinal fluid to leak. They also said the knife was just 2 mm away from his spinal cord. Mr Khan, they said, is recovering well. He was released from hospital on Tuesday and has been advised bed rest for a week. The accused, Shariful, is a Bangladeshi national who entered India illegally. He has told police that someone had promised to get fake citizenship documents made for him in exchange for money. This, he has said, was why he attempted the burglary at Mr Khan's home. Police are now looking for the person who promised to get Shariful's documents made. The sources have said Mumbai Police had contacted Western Railway to help identify the suspect captured on footage of CCTV cameras in the 12-storey building where the actor lives. The accused, it is learnt, had boarded a train from Bandra station and Railways had used its facial recognition system to shortlist some suspects whose appearance matched the intruder's. Sources said this was done because the footage of the intruder exiting the building was unclear. While Shariful was arrested based on CCTV footage, police are trying to gather more evidence to build a bulletproof case against him.

Washington: President Donald Trump has instructed the US military to release a hold imposed by former President Joe Biden on the supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, a White House source told Reuters on Saturday. The move was widely expected. Biden put a hold on the delivery of those bombs due to concern over the impact they could have on the civilian population, particularly in Gaza's Rafah, during Israel's war in the Palestinian enclave. \"A lot of things that were ordered and paid for by Israel, but have not been sent by Biden, are now on their way!\" Trump said on the Truth Social media platform without providing further details. Trump and Biden have been strong supporters of US ally Israel, even as Washington has come under criticism from human rights advocates over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from Israel's military assault against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Protesters have unsuccessfully demanded an arms embargo. A ceasefire went into effect a week ago and has led to the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Before his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump had warned there would be \"hell to pay\" if hostages held by Hamas in Gaza were not released. Hamas took around 250 hostages during an Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli tallies. It sparked the latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed more than 47,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and led to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies. It also displaced nearly Gaza's entire population and caused a hunger crisis. Washington says it is helping Israel defend against Iran-backed militant groups like Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.

New Delhi: Raman Rajamannan, the 'king' of Kerala's Mannan community, will attend the 76th Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi on January 26. King Rajamannan will be accompanied by his wife Binumol. OR Kelu, Minister for Welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes, handed over the Republic Day invitation to the tribal king. This will be the first time a tribal king will attend the Republic Day parade in Delhi. Rajamannan, the only tribal king in Kerala, and his wife flew to Delhi on Wednesday. They will visit various places after the parade and return on February 2. Travel expenses will be borne by the Scheduled Caste Development Department, Minister Kelu said in a social media post. He will wear headgear (thalappavu) and traditional clothes, marking the special occasion and will be assisted by two Ministers and soldiers during the functions. Rajamannan is the head of 300 families of Mannans, a tribal clan living in 48 settlements in the Idukki district. The King holds a special place in the rituals and festivities of the Mannan community. He took the reins of his little kingdom, back in 2012, after the death of Aryan Rajamannan. An economics graduate, Rajamannan lives an ordinary life as a farmer. He doesn't have a royal palace or a chariot. Instead, he resides in a simple house and manages a local temple along with his family. The king has no rights or duties in civil society, but oversees community matters with the help of four upa rajas (deputies), one ilayaraja (prince), and a 50-member council of ministers, known as kaanis, reported The Indian Express. Reportedly, the Mannan community follows a matrilineal system, meaning women hold the inheritance rights.

More so in India, where competition can be intense. But then, Indian sport is abound with stories where despite humble background, players rose to became stars with sheer discipline and hard work. Former India player Manoj Tiwary is one such name. He played 12 ODIs and three T20Is for India. But had he been a little more fortunate, he would have featured in more international matches. Tiwary played with the likes Sachin Tendulkar , MS Dhoni , Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma , Gautam Gambhir  during his time with the Indian cricket team. He scored 796 runs at an average 99.50 in the 2006-07 Ranji Trophy season. He led Bengal for a long time and was one of the best cricketers to emerge from the state. Tiwary, however, had to face a lot of struggle both on and off the field. He even thought of taking early retirement after he did not get enough opportunities for an extended period in the Indian team. \"Due to responsibility, I did not take early retirement,\" he said. He was also asked on his struggle in the teenage years when he had to work hard to pay off loans. \"Those were difficult times. One thing I always had in mind was that I had to pay off the loan. We have Mangla Haat In Kolkata, there I used to sell poori sabzi . My mom used to make the pooris. Sometimes people did not even pay for the food that they ate,\" Manoj Tiwary said on Lallantop . \"I worked in factories of nut and bolts. This was around when I was around 14 years old. I got Rs 1200 per match when I played in U-16 level. So I did the maths and made sure I did well in cricket so that the  money always comes. I ran away from the factory. It was too hectic. The factory owner used to make us work.\" When his debut came in 2008 it was not special. He slammed his maiden ODI century against West Indies in Chennai in 2011, but was benched for months after that game. MS Dhoni was the skipper of the side duting that time. Advertisement \"He was the captain. Team India runs according to the planning of the skipper. In state teams, things are different but in Team India its all about the captain. If you see, during Kapil Dev 's time it was he who ran the show, during Sunil Gavaskar 's tenure it was his call, same was during Mohammad Azharuddin 's tenure. After that Dada and so on. This will go on unless a strict administrator comes and makes a set rule,\" Manoj Tiwary said. Listen to the latest songs , only on JioSaavn.com \"You see Ajit Agarkar (current BCCI chief selector) and you feel he can take strong decisions. He can disagree with the coach. As far as me being dropped for 14 matches after scoring a century, if a player is dropped after scoring a century, obviously I want to know the answer. After century I was praised, but post that I did not have any inkling. At that time, youngsters used to feel afraid, including me. If you ask something, who knows what way it could have been taken. Career is on the line. \"The players who were in the team then were Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina , Rohit Sharma. After that the Tour which took place, they were not making runs. And here I was, even after making a century and winning Player of the Match, could not find a place in playing XI. I was dropped for 14 matches, which took place in a space of six months.

A \"fiery\" phone call between President Donald Trump and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has reignited the debate over Greenland's future, with the US leader's intentions remaining unclear. Trump's unwavering stance on taking over Greenland, despite officials' repeated assertions that it's not for sale, has left many in Denmark and Greenland reeling. At the heart of Trump's interest in Greenland lies its strategic importance for national security. The island is rich in minerals crucial for technology and defense, including rare earth elements used in mobile phones, electric vehicles, and weapons. With China dominating the global rare earth market, Greenland's reserves have become increasingly vital to the US. Trump has been wanting to take over the island nation of 56,000 people since his first term. Greenland's location, straddling the shortest route between Europe and North America, makes it a critical spot for the US military and its ballistic missile early-warning system. As China and Russia expand their influence in the Arctic, the US seeks to maintain its dominance in the region. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, told Fox that Trump has made it clear \"the safety and security of Greenland is important to the United States as China and Russia make significant investments throughout the Arctic region. The President is committed to not only protecting U.S. interests in the Arctic but also working with Greenland to ensure mutual prosperity for both nations\". \"He was very firm,\" a source told the Financial Times, describing Trump's tone during the phone call. \"It was a cold shower. Before, it was hard to take it seriously. But I do think it is serious, and potentially very dangerous.\" The phone call was \"fiery\" with one official calling it \"horrendous\", per the Financial Times. The call \"utterly freaked out\" the Danes, one Danish official said. \"The intent was very clear,\" another official told the outlet. \"They want it. The Danes are now in crisis mode.\" Trump's aggressive pursuit of Greenland has been met with resistance from Denmark and Greenland. Frederiksen has emphasised that Greenland is not for sale, and its Prime Minister, Mute Edege, has reiterated that the island's people do not want to be part of the US. However, repeatedly, the US says that Greenland is important for its national security. Despite Frederiksen's offer to increase the cooperation between Greenland and US on military bases and resources, Trump was aggressive and confrontational. Moreover he has not ruled out the possible use of military force in Greenland. \"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social last month. Residents of Greenland have also expressed their distrust of Trump and his intentions. \"I don't trust the guy,\" Bilo Chemnitz, a resident of Nuuk, told The Washington Post. \"I want Greenland to stay like it is.\" \"I don't like the way he talks about Greenland,\" resident Ida Abelsen similarly told the Post. The diplomatic relations between the US and Denmark have been put to the test, as Trump's pursuit of Greenland continues to garner attention and criticism.

Press Trust of India Updated: January 26, 2025 08:29 am IST Read Time: 3 min facebook twitter WhatsApp reddit E-mail Shubman Gill has, of late, developed a tendency to lose focus after getting 25-30 runs. © X (Twitter) India batter Shubman Gill on Saturday conceded that he has, of late, developed a tendency to lose focus after getting 25-30 runs in red-ball cricket, evidence of which was seen in a couple of his dismissals during the five-match Test series in Australia. Gill identified this as an area of concern soon after making a fine second-innings hundred for Punjab on the third day of their Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka. His 102-run knock, though, went in vain as Karnataka hammered the visitors by an innings and 207 runs. \"Red-ball batting is a concern. Sometimes, I think with the red ball, in the matches that I play, I get very good 25-30 runs. \"I think in those moments, sometimes I put too much pressure on myself to be able to score big runs. I think that is not the way that I have grown up playing my game,\" Gill said. The elegant batter, who is a treat to watch when in full flow, added, \"There is a certain zone that I am in, certain intent that I am in and sometimes I think I lose that because I put too much pressure on myself that I have to get a big run now that I am set. \"I think in those crucial moments, I sometimes lose my focus and concentration. I think it keeps you in the game all the time. \"As a person, I like to be involved in the game and what is happening. I think it brings out the best in me as a player when I am constantly involved in the game.\" On the Indian team's last tour of Australia, Gill made just 93 runs in six innings at an average of 18.60. He missed the series opener in Perth due to injury and was dropped for the Boxing Day Test at MCG. This innings on Saturday will give him some confidence going forward. \"I think any innings that we play at any level, it's very important to be able to get runs, get back in form and have that feel. When you are playing well, when you are in that zone, it's important to stay in that zone as long as possible and that's what I was trying to do when I was batting there. Advertisement He described the knock as \"satisfying\", having got out off an inside edge in the first innings. \"I think this innings was very satisfying for me, the way I played. The first, I think, in 130 balls, I scored 40-odd runs, and they were bowling well and there was some help in the wicket as well. So, keeping that in mind, I think I was very satisfied with the way that I was playing. \"After the lunch, I just thought to play a little bit more of my shots. Also, the wickets were falling from one end. So, I wanted to make sure that I am getting some runs as well, playing some shots.\" He said no amount of practice can give a player what he derives from playing in a competitive match at this level. \"I think if there is a chance, we must keep in mind that there is enough of a gap between the match and the next series that you are going to play. So, if there is enough gap, if there is 15-20 days between that, then I think it is very helpful to play the match because the match feels different no matter how much you practice. Advertisement \"When you go out there playing at any level, there are certain aspects of your game that are challenged when you are playing a match. So, it is helpful.\" Gill likened this surface to the one that was used for the Test match against New Zealand three months ago. \"I think the first inning when we batted, the wicket was quite damp. I think it was like the match that we played against New Zealand here. The only difference that I would say, there was a little bit more grass on this wicket. \"And in the second innings, I think it got a little easier to play your shots. In the first inning, the ball was stopping and seemed a bit too much to play the shots. Listen to the latest songs , only on JioSaavn.com \"In the second inning, the ball was still, I felt seaming, but it was still easier to play your shots because the ball was coming at a good pace.\" Among the India stars returning to the domestic circuit, Gill was the lone centurion and played 171 balls for his knock.

Posted by: Srishti Kapoor India News Jan 26, 2025 09:43 am IST Published On Jan 26, 2025 09:29 am IST Last Updated On Jan 26, 2025 09:43 am IST Read Time: 2 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Mr Sompura is the grandson of Padma Shri Prabhashankarbhai Oghadbhai Somapura. Chandrakant Sompura, the architect of the Ram temple in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya, is among the Padma Shri recipients this year. He comes from a family of temple architects that have designed over 200 such structures. He had told NDTV in an earlier interview that he had designed the Ram temple over 30 years ago using his footsteps as a unit of measurement. \"At that time, we were not allowed to take measuring tapes. I was told just have a look around alone. It was very difficult for me to envision a temple without proper measurement. So, I used my feet and counted the steps. I remembered all the steps - from left to right, across, and replicated the design inside a big hall where I could take proper measurement,\" Mr Somapura had said. The 80-year-old envisioned the temple in Ayodhya, constructed over an area of 2,7 acres in the traditional Nagar style without using iron. Mr Sompura is the grandson of Padma Shri Prabhashankarbhai Oghadbhai Somapura, whom he also considers his teacher. As per his website, he was awarded Best Architect Of The Year 1997 award and his creation of Shri Akshar Purshottam Swaminarayan Temple at London was recognised by the Guiness Book of World Records. Further, he created the Akshardham temple in Gujarat's Gandhinagar, 108 Bhaktivihar, and temples in Singapore and USA, all of which received widespread appreciation.

Sky Force Box Office Collection Day 2 Akshay Kumar-Veer Pahariya's film saw a massive 75.51% uptick in earnings on its second day in theatres. According to Sacnilk data, the film earned ₹ 21.5 crore on Saturday. With this, the film has minted a total of ₹ 33.75 crore in two days.

Akshay Kumar’s movie’s advance booking for Day 1 Heavily discounted tickets The industry tracker said Sky Force might not have been able to collect this much money with regular ticket prices from the opening day. However, it highlighted that having heavily discounted ticket prices is not a good long-term plan, even if it has worked in favour of movies to bring the audience in large numbers and spread word of mouth. The movie's second-day collection indicates that it has managed to draw moviegoers' attention, but its real test will begin on Monday. A good hold during working days, possibly with positive word of mouth, will put the movie in the best position to score a success, Sacnilk said. Sky Force Box Office Collection Day 1 Veer Pahariya has been a lucky charm for Akshay Kumar , who is marking his best movie premiere in years with Sky Force. After years of box office flops for Akshay, this aerial action thriller opened to double-digit collections. His last hit movie was Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi in 2021.

The second message, he said, focuses on the preservation of nature and ecology. \"I hope this artwork inspires awareness of the incredible wildlife that exists in our country. India is truly gifted, and preserving this natural wealth is crucial. This planet does not belong to humans alone, and climate change is a pressing reality. Let us remain conscious of our environment and the extraordinary species with whom we share this planet,\" he added.",

        "summary": "In just five days, President Trump has made waves with bold decisions, from terminating Fauci's security to reshaping FEMA. These early actions hint at a presidency focused on immigration, oversight elimination, and social policies that challenge the previous administration's legacy.",
        "full_content": "Donald Trump, with less than a week into his presidency, has touted deportation efforts and published new rules making it easier to remove people — fulfilling his campaign promise to tackle illegal immigration. President Donald Trump’s first week in office isn't over yet, but already it offers signals about how his next four years in the White House may unfold. Here's a look at 5 bold decisions the newly sworn-in US President took on Friday: 1. Fired 17 independent inspectors Donald Trump fired 17 independent inspectors at multiple government agencies, eliminating a critical oversight component and clearing the way to replace them with loyalists, according to news agency Reuters. Reportedly, the dismissals appeared to violate federal law, which requires the president to give both houses of Congress reasons for the dismissals 30 days in advance, it added.

Cutting taxes on tips President Trump visited Las Vegas to discuss cutting taxes on tips, a promise he made for his 2024 campaign. In his second term, the new Republican president has rolled back many policies from his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, and begun working on his pledge to reshape and reduce the federal government. 3. Questions FEMA’s future Donald Trump has raised concerns about FEMA’s (Federal Emergency Management Agency) future role and appointed a former Navy SEAL as an interim chief - who has no prior experience in FEMA. Los Angeles, struggling with its worst natural disaster in decades, desperately needs FEMA. As new fires threaten homes in the city, FEMA has sent about 550 experts to help displaced residents find shelter, get aid, and coordinate debris removal. Also Read | Donald Trump tussles with Denmark PM Mette Frederiksen over Greenland 4. Reinstating anti-abortion pacts Trump utilized his executive power to restore US participation in two international anti-abortion pacts, including one that cuts off US family planning funds for foreign organizations that provide or promote abortions. He also reinstated the Mexico City Policy for silencing abortion advocates. Originally created by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the policy has been reversed by each Democratic president and reinstated when a Republican returns to office.

Terminates Anthony Fauci’s security Trump terminated Dr. Anthony Fauci's security, a former top health official who has faced threats since leading the country's COVID-19 response, and said he should hire his own security. Fauci is the latest in a string of former Trump aides-turned-critics to see their federal protection canceled despite ongoing threats to their lives. (With inputs from agencies)",
