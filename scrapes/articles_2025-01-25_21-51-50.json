NDTV Newsdesk India News Jan 25, 2025 20:54 pm IST Published On Jan 25, 2025 19:39 pm IST Last Updated On Jan 25, 2025 20:54 pm IST Read Time: 4 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Calling it a reform that will \"redefine the terms of good governance\", President Droupadi Murmu said the 'One Nation, One Election' bill will help check \"policy paralysis, mitigate resource division, and reduce financial burden\". \"Reforms of such magnitude require an audacity of vision. Another measure that promises to redefine the terms of good governance is the Bill introduced in Parliament to synchronise election schedules in the country. The 'One Nation One Election' plan can promote consistency in governance, prevent policy paralysis, mitigate resource diversion, and reduce the financial burden, apart from offering many other benefits,\" said President Murmu addressing the nation on the eve of 76th Republic Day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has frequently emphasised the need for simultaneous polls, arguing that the country incurs significant costs and disruptions from ongoing election seasons. Former president Ram Nath Kovind, who headed a panel on 'one nation, one election,' has said that the idea of simultaneous polls was perceived by the framers of the Constitution and therefore it cannot be unconstitutional. He pointed out that the first four Lok Sabha and assembly polls were held together till 1967, asking how could synchronised polls be dubbed as unconstitutional. The Congress has argued that the simultaneous polls idea is against the basic structure of the Constitution and that it would oppose it \"tooth and nail\". It has also called the idea of 'one nation, one election' anti-democratic and anti-federal. Apart from syncing electoral cycles, there is no real clarity on how to deal with breaks due to dissolution of Houses, President's Rule, or even a hung Assembly or Parliament. The President emphasised the government's ongoing efforts to \"eliminate remnants of a colonial mindset that have lingered in the country for decades\" and cited the replacement of the British-era criminal laws with three new modern laws. \"We have been witnessing concerted efforts to change that mindset... Reforms of such magnitude require an audacity of vision,\" she said. She mentioned the introduction of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, which prioritise the delivery of justice over mere punishment and place a strong emphasis on addressing crimes against women and children. The President also pointed to the persistently high economic growth rate in recent years, which has generated job opportunities, increased income for farmers and labourers, and lifted many out of poverty. She underscored the importance of inclusive growth and the government's commitment to welfare, making basic necessities such as housing and access to clean drinking water entitlements for citizens. Efforts to support marginalised communities, particularly those belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC), were also highlighted. The President highlighted the inclusive nature of the Constituent Assembly, which represented diverse communities across the nation, including 15 women members who played pivotal roles in shaping the country's democratic framework. \"When women's equality was a distant goal in many parts of the world, Indian women were actively engaged in the nation's destiny,\" she said. The Constitution, according to the President, has evolved into a living document that serves as the foundation of India's collective identity and has guided the nation's progress over the past 75 years. The President praised the early 20th-century freedom fighters for uniting the nation in a well-organised independence movement and credited iconic figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, and Babasaheb Ambedkar for helping India rediscover its democratic values. \"Justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity are not just modern concepts; they have always been integral to our civilisational heritage,\" she asserted, noting that skeptics of the Constitution's future were proven wrong.

Harvinder Singh, who won gold in the Paris 2024 Summer Paralympic Games, has also been honoured with the Padma Shri award. \"With deep gratitude and honour, I accept the gracious invitation to the at-home reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on 26th of January.

Padma Shri awardee Libia Lobo Sardesai played an important role in Goa's freedom movement and co-founded an underground radio station -- Voz da Liberdabe (Voice of Freedom) -- in a forested area in 1955 to rally people against Portuguese rule. Gokul Chandra Dey, a 57-year old dhak player from Bengal, who broke gender stereotype by training 150 women in the male-dominated field, is one of the awardees. Mr Dey also created a lightweight dhak type, 1.5 kg less than the conventional instrument, and represented India at international platforms. He performed with maestros like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Zakir Hussain. A strong supporter of woman empowerment, 82-year old Sally Holkar transformed the once-dying Maheshwari craft and founded a handloom school in Maheshwar, Madhya Pradesh, to train people in traditional weaving techniques. Born in the US and inspired by Rani Ahilyabai Holkar's legacy, she devoted five decades of her life to revitalise the 300-year-old weaving legacy. She has been awarded the Padma Shri.

They were brought in military uniform and made to stand on a podium and wave. They were handed over to Red Cross members and the vehicle has now left Gaza with the hostages. The soldiers have reunited with their families in Israel, with crowds shedding tears of joy as they gathered to watch the release at a Hostage Square, a plaza in Tel Aviv. Hamas had mentioned on Friday that they would release the four Israeli women soldiers who had been held hostage since October 7, 2023. This is the second exchange under the ceasefire deal between Israel and Gaza. All four were taken captive from Nahal Oz military base, about a kilometre away from the Gaza border. Naama Levy, 20 Her video circulated on social media right after abduction. It showed her bruised and cut, her trousers stained with blood, with her hands tied. She was being pushed into a vehicle by a gunman. Daniella Gilboa, 20 She was wounded during the attack on October 7th, and appeared limping during the capture. In a video released by Hamas last year, she appealed angrily to the government to work for her release. Liri Albag, 19 She was taken hostage just a day and a half after beginning her military service. Hamas had released her video as well, reading a message and appealing for her release. Karina Ariev, 20 She could only speak briefly with her parents before being taken away. Soon after, a video of was released by the Hamas which showed her with a bandaged head with blood stains. Per the plan, post the release of the four Israeli women soldiers, Israel should free a group of 200 Palestinian prisoners incarcerated in Israeli jails, according to Reuters. This fragile deal is set to build the foundation for a permanent end to the war in Gaza. After the ceasefire announcement, many displaced Gazans tried to go back home after more than a year of incessant war, but they only found rubble in place of where the houses once stood. \"Even if we thought about returning, there is no place for us to put our tents because of the destruction,\" Theqra Qasem, a displaced woman, told AFP. The ceasefire announcement has been made a reality through the efforts of three countries: Qatar, Egypt and the United States after months of negotiation. However, Donald Trump claimed full credit for the ceasefire deal, “This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November\", as he posted on his Truth Social account. According to the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages Israel believes are still alive should be returned in exchange for 1900 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. A more permanent end to the war is expected in the next phase of the war, and the last phase should see the reconstruction of Gaza and the return of the bodies of dead hostages.

The footage shows Sinwar on Gaza battlefields, directing military operations in the Rafah area. The Palestinian leader is seen wearing a military vest, a stick in his hand, and covered by a blanket.

In another scene, Sinwar is seen in a polo shirt with another man, and a map spread out before them. The network also reportedly ran a visual of the order that Sinwar, the then chief of Hamas, had signed to begin the October 7 assault. Who Was Yahya Sinwar? Sinwar, who had risen through the ranks of Hamas, was killed on October 18 last year during an Israeli raid, hours after he was spotted moving his belongings in a Gaza tunnel. Israel accuses him of being the mastermind of the October 7 attacks, the deadliest in their history that sparked the Middle East conflict and brought a sharp divide between the West and other pro-Palestine countries. Footage released by Israel on October 18 showed a fragile Sinwar during his final moments. In his last-ditch attempt to fight back, he was seen throwing an object at the drone filming him. Israel later dropped leaflets with Sinwar's image and a message that \"Hamas will no longer rule Gaza\".

In response, Israel started pounding Gaza with aerial strikes alongside ground operations. Hamas claims Israeli operations have led to over 47,000 deaths in the Gaza Strip. Sinwar's latest footage emerges at a time when Israel and Hamas have shunned violence for a brief period to swap prisoners and hostages as part of a ceasefire deal that aims to bring peace in the Middle East and end the year-long conflict.

Tahawwur Hussain Rana, who has been convicted in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks case, has lost his last legal option in the US to avoid extradition to India. The Supreme Court in the US approved Rana's extradition on Saturday as it dismissed the terror convict's review request against his conviction. This clears the way for India to extradite the terror mastermind and bring him to justice. Besides Rana, India is trying to bring back several other offenders who had turned fugitive to escape the laws back home. The government said last month that of all the fugitives, one-third are hiding in the US, which has become a \"safe haven\" for criminals and terrorists. Here's a list of 5 key extradition battles being fought by the country abroad: Tahawwur Hussain Rana Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman, is wanted for his role in the Mumbai attacks in which over 160 people were killed. A former military doctor who has served in the Pakistan Army, he had prior knowledge of the 2008 attacks. He was arrested in 2009 for a terror plot in Denmark. Apart from this case, he has been convicted of helping Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) with material support. In the latest update, the US Supreme Court has cleared his extradition to India. Read: US Supreme Court Clears 26/11 Convict Tahawwur Rana's Extradition To India Arsh Dalla Khalistani terrorist Arshdeep Singh Gill alia Arsh Dalla, the de-facto leader of the banned outfit Khalistan Tiger Force, is based in Canada. He is wanted in India in over 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion, and terrorist acts. He was designed a \"terrorist\" in January, 2004. Sources suggest he has been in touch with the Pakistani spy agency ISI. Dalla was arrested last October after he was injured in an attack. Since then, India has been trying to extradite him, but he secured a bail in December. Read: Khalistani Terrorist Arsh Dalla Gets Bail In Canada Amid India's Push For Extradition Anmol Bishnoi Anmol Bishnoi is the younger brother of Lawrence Bishnoi, who runs the dreaded Bishnoi gang from a jail in Gujarat. He is wanted in India for several high-profile cases, including murders of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala and politician Baba Siddique. Anmol was arrested in US last November for entering the country without valid documents. Intelligence sources had indicated there was no possibility for him to extradited so soon despite custody request from Delhi.

He is wanted in India for fraud after the collapse of his now-defunct company Kingfisher Airlines. He was declared a fugitive in 2019. India is in a long legal fight for the custody of Mallya, which is unlikely to end anytime soon. Back home, a CBI court issued a fresh non-bailable warrant against him last year in a separate Rs 180 crore loan default case. Nirav Modi Diamantaire Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi are the key accused in the Rs 14,000 crore PNB loan fraud case. The two are being probed over an alleged nexus with the bank officials that helped them with the fraud. Nirav Modi left the country in 2018 and was arrested in London the same year. Lodged in a UK jail now, he has lost all his petitions against extradition to India so far. Mehul Choksi is now in Antigua. Besides, there is a list of several other offenders that India is trying to bring back. The list includes Sanjay Bhandari, an arms deal consultant, who is in the UK and faces charges of tax evasion and money laundering. Sourabh Chandrakar, promoter of the Mahadev betting app, is also facing extradition over money laundering charges after his arrest in Dubai in 2023. It was reported then that he has been kept under \"house detention\" amid efforts by Indian agencies to secure his deportation.

Furthermore, Kejriwal has been projected as an honest man and targeting senior Congress leaders such as Gandhi, Maken, and Dikshit are dishonest people. \"It is submitted that the said post is baseless and without any authenticity thereby trying to malign the reputation of senior Congress leaders during the election time. The said post is a malicious attempt for political gains,\" the complaint stated.

Edited by: Anushree Jonko World News Jan 25, 2025 20:41 pm IST Published On Jan 25, 2025 20:39 pm IST Last Updated On Jan 25, 2025 20:41 pm IST Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email A \"fiery\" phone call between Trump and Mette Frederiksen has reignited the debate over Greenland's future The notion of the United States purchasing Greenland has been a topic of discussion for months, but recent developments suggest that President Trump's administration is more serious about the proposition than initially thought. A \"fiery\" phone call between President Donald Trump and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has reignited the debate over Greenland's future, with the US leader's intentions remaining unclear. Trump's unwavering stance on taking over Greenland, despite officials' repeated assertions that it's not for sale, has left many in Denmark and Greenland reeling. At the heart of Trump's interest in Greenland lies its strategic importance for national security. The island is rich in minerals crucial for technology and defense, including rare earth elements used in mobile phones, electric vehicles, and weapons. With China dominating the global rare earth market, Greenland's reserves have become increasingly vital to the US. Trump has been wanting to take over the island nation of 56,000 people since his first term. Greenland's location, straddling the shortest route between Europe and North America, makes it a critical spot for the US military and its ballistic missile early-warning system. As China and Russia expand their influence in the Arctic, the US seeks to maintain its dominance in the region. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, told Fox that Trump has made it clear \"the safety and security of Greenland is important to the United States as China and Russia make significant investments throughout the Arctic region. The President is committed to not only protecting U.S. interests in the Arctic but also working with Greenland to ensure mutual prosperity for both nations\". \"He was very firm,\" a source told the Financial Times, describing Trump's tone during the phone call. \"It was a cold shower. Before, it was hard to take it seriously. But I do think it is serious, and potentially very dangerous.\" The phone call was \"fiery\" with one official calling it \"horrendous\", per the Financial Times. The call \"utterly freaked out\" the Danes, one Danish official said. \"The intent was very clear,\" another official told the outlet. \"They want it. The Danes are now in crisis mode.\" Trump's aggressive pursuit of Greenland has been met with resistance from Denmark and Greenland. Frederiksen has emphasised that Greenland is not for sale, and its Prime Minister, Mute Edege, has reiterated that the island's people do not want to be part of the US. However, repeatedly, the US says that Greenland is important for its national security. Despite Frederiksen's offer to increase the cooperation between Greenland and US on military bases and resources, Trump was aggressive and confrontational. Moreover he has not ruled out the possible use of military force in Greenland. \"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social last month. Residents of Greenland have also expressed their distrust of Trump and his intentions. \"I don't trust the guy,\" Bilo Chemnitz, a resident of Nuuk, told The Washington Post. \"I want Greenland to stay like it is.\" \"I don't like the way he talks about Greenland,\" resident Ida Abelsen similarly told the Post. The diplomatic relations between the US and Denmark have been put to the test, as Trump's pursuit of Greenland continues to garner attention and criticism.

In a boost to Jammu and Kashmir's rail connectivity, the India Railways on Saturday successfully conducted the first trial run of the specially designed Vande Bharat Express train. The train, which travelled from Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra (SVDK) railway station to Srinagar railway station, passed through the Chenab bridge - the world's highest rail bridge. It also ran through Anji Khad bridge - which is India's first cable-stayed railway bridge. The train briefly halted at Jammu around 11:30 am where it was welcomed with slogans and praises for the Indian Railways. It then moved to the next Budgam station to complete its trial run. Commercial operations of the train are set to begin soon, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to flag off the first journey from Katra. The date of the flagging-off ceremony is yet to be announced. Special features of the train The Vande Bharat train is designed to operate seamlessly in Jammu and Kashmir's challenging winter conditions and has special climate-related features. Compared to the other Vande Bharat Express trains running in different parts of the country, this train has several additional features to meet operational challenges and passengers' needs. It includes advanced heating systems that prevent the freezing of water and bio-toilet tanks, provide warm air for the vacuum system, and ensure optimal functioning of the air-brake system for smooth operations even in sub-zero temperatures. The train also features embedded heating elements in the windshield to automatically defrost the driver's front lookout glass, ensuring clear visibility in harsh winter conditions. Apart from these, the train includes other amenities of the existing Vande Bharat trains such as fully air-conditioned coaches, automatic plug doors, and mobile charging sockets. According to officials, the train symbolises India's commitment to bridging geographical and economic gaps, reported PTI. This train marks a significant step towards completing the 272-km USBRL (Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link) project - aimed at connecting the Kashmir valley to the broader Indian Railway network.

Already doubts persist over whether Mohammed Shami , after missing the first match that the hosts won in Kolkata, will be available for the second match in Chennai on Saturday. In the midst of this, BCCI has said fast-bowling allrounder Nitish Reddy has not recovered from an injury. In his place, Shivam Dube - member of India's 2024 T20 World Cup-winning squad - has been called up. Dube featured in the recent Ranji Trophy match between Mumbai and Jammu and Kashmir, which the former lost. Dube was ignored for the T20I series against England. Dube travelled to Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka for the T20I series after the World Cup triumph but was ignored for the subsequent home series against Bangladesh, as well as the away tour of South Africa. Rinku Singh has also been ruled out of the second and third T20Is. \"All-rounder Nitish Reddy sustained a side strain injury in the practice session on 24th January in Chennai. He is ruled out of the ongoing 5-match T20I series. Reddy will head to the BCCI Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru for further management,\" the BCCI said. \"Rinku Singh sustained a low back spasm while fielding in the 1st T20I against England on 22nd January. He is progressing well and the BCCI medical team is monitoring him closely. He is ruled out of the 2nd and 3rd games of the ongoing 5-match T20I series. \"The Senior Selection Committee has included Shivam Dube and Ramandeep Singh in the squad.\" \"What happened to Shivam Dube? I wanted to talk about Ruturaj (Gaikwad) as well but he is not able to make his place. Rajat Patidar is also there. Obviously, there is a lot of batting. However, now I am going to focus a little bit on Shivam Dube. He was a member of the T20 World Cup-winning team,\" Aakash Chopra , former Indian opener, said on his YouTube channel. Advertisement \"When you win, everyone should get the credit. He even played decently in the final. Before that, there were definitely some questions that he wasn't fielding or batting well. However, then he played well and became the T20 World Cup champion.\" Nitish Reddy recently made a great Test debut in the Border Gavaskar Trophy that ended earlier this month scoring a ton at the Melbourne cricket ground. Chopra also felt Dube deserved a longer rope in the team, especially with the southpaw playing a crucial role in India's T20 World Cup triumph. Listen to the latest songs , only on JioSaavn.com \"After that, he remained injured a little, didn't get too many opportunities either, and is now out of the team. No one is talking about him as well. Riyan Parag is not being talked about because he is injured but no one is asking where Dube went. He suddenly disappeared from the horizon,\" Chopra questioned.

Hamas released four Israeli women hostages on Saturday in what was the second exchange under the ceasefire deal between Israel and Gaza. As the world watched, the soldiers, in military uniform, were handed over to Red Cross members. As the fragile ceasefire holds in Gaza, the fate of the Bibas family and the youngest Hamas hostage remains unknown. Shiri Bibas, her two sons, Ariel (5) and Kfir (2), and her husband, Yarden, were among those kidnapped by the group on October 7, 2023. Baby Kfir, the youngest hostage, was just 8 months old at the time. The Bibas family's hopes were shattered when their names were missing from the list of hostages to be freed in the latest phase of the multi-phase ceasefire deal. In a statement, the family shared their anguish. According to The Times of Israel, the statement read, “Yesterday at 16:00, when the list of those set for release was published, our world collapsed. Even though we were prepared for this possibility, we had hoped to see Shiri and the children on the list that was supposed to be for civilian women.” While Israeli authorities insist on the return of Kfir and Ariel, Hamas has claimed that Shiri and her two boys are no longer alive. Israeli officials have not confirmed this, and the uncertainty has left the family anxious. An analyst told ABC News that whether they're alive depends on who is asked about it. Should they be confirmed dead, it is likely to unleash fury and sadness in Israel, where the family has become a symbol of the country's darkest moment. According to an AFP report, Israeli Defence Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari expressed “deep concerns” over the well-being of the two remaining child hostages from the Bibas family in Gaza. In a televised statement on Saturday, Hagari said that Israel insists on the return of Kfir and Ariel Bibas. Hagari added, “We are deeply concerned for their fate,” and also mentioned their mother, whose deaths Hamas had announced more than a year ago but Israeli authorities have not confirmed. Meanwhile, the family's plea remains steadfast — “Shiri, Yarden, Ariel, and Kfir — We will continue to hope and demand your return. It's not over until it's over,” they said in the statement. The three-stage Ceasefire deal is currently in its first phase as part of which 33 of the remaining 98 hostages - women, children, men over 50, the ill and wounded - will be released in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. In the first phase, Israeli forces would also withdraw from Gaza and allow the displaced population to return \"to their residences\", the Qatari prime minister earlier said. The first phase will last six weeks.

Stargazers are in or a treat as six planets - Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus - are set to align in the night sky today, January 25, offering a spectacular view. The six planets will form an astronomical alignment known as the \"planetary parade\". This celestial spectacle has been visible for most of the month, beginning around January 18, and will continue through early February. However, tonight all the six planets will meet up together on the same side of the sun in a wide arc above Earth and most of them will be visible to the naked eye under clear night skies. According to NASA, such events, especially those involving four or more planets, are noteworthy and do not occur annually. Moreover, what makes this event extraordinary is the number of visible bright planets, including Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus, which doesn't happen every year. Planetary Parade: What is it? According to Space.com , the planets in our solar system orbit the sun essentially along a line across the sky in a plane called the ecliptic. For that reason, planets in our Earthly sky always appear somewhere along a line. These events, while commonplace, are often referred to as planetary alignments. Astronomers say that while tonight's event might be overhyped as some type of \"rare alignment,\" it's actually a regular occurrence in our night sky. But what could be noteworthy for stargazers is the six planets that will be visible - including four with the naked eye. Such an event is commonly known as a \"planet parade,\" though NASA noted that the moniker is not a technical astronomical term. Planetary Parade: When and how to see the alignment The best time to catch the event is about 45 minutes after sunset. The four planets - Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn - will be visible to the naked eye just after the sun goes down, but Uranus and Neptune will require a telescope. NASA stated that after dark, Venus and Saturn will be visible in the southwest. Jupiter will shine brightly overhead, and Mars will rise in the east. The alignment will last for up to three hours, until Venus and Saturn dip below the horizon. Venus will be the most visible and brightest of these planets. Mars will look like a bright lightbulb because of its red colour. Saturn will appear as a tiny dot in the western sky, while Jupiter will also be similar but in the southern sky. Uranus and Neptune can be seen as tiny, bright dots but will not be visible to the naked eye due to their distance from the other planets in the alignment. Planetary Parade: Visibility in India The planetary alignment will be visible across India. Most cities will be able to witness this rare event. Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are visible to the naked eye. However, you will need a telescope to see Neptune and Uranus, as they are faint. The Pathani Samant Planetarium in Bhubaneswar has made elaborate arrangements for visitors, PTI quoted an official as saying. Visitors will be able to witness the rare event on all days, except Monday, from 5.30 pm to 7.30 pm. The Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre (TNSTC) is also organising a special night sky observation at Kotturpuram-based Periyar Science and Technology Centre from January 22 to 25. Moreover, to offer the public an opportunity to witness this remarkable phenomenon, the Gujarat Council on Science and Technology (GUJCOST), under the Department of Science and Technology of Gujarat, has also organised a series of public observation programs. Planetary Parade: Ideal spot to witness the celestial event Choose a spot with an unobstructed view of the western horizon. To minimize light pollution, opt for a location away from city lights. Although Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn can be seen with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope will provide a clearer view, particularly for Neptune and Uranus. Clear skies are crucial for the best viewing experience.
